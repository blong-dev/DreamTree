# The DreamTree Principles

These principles guide every decision we make — what we build, how we build it, and why.

---

## 1. Your Data Belongs to You

Not to us. Not to advertisers. Not to AI companies. You.

Your contributions are encrypted with keys only you control. You can export everything, anytime. You can delete everything, permanently. We architect systems where we *cannot* access your data — not as policy, but as math.

This is data sovereignty: ownership enforced by cryptography, not promises.

---

## 2. Contributions Deserve Recognition

Every skill you've learned, every story you've lived, every insight you've had — these are your contributions to the world. They have value. That value should be tracked, attributed, and returned to you.

We reject the attention economy, where your time and data are extracted and sold. We're building a contribution economy, where what you create remains yours and works for you.

---

## 3. Open Source, Open Standards

Trust requires transparency. Our core is open source. Our protocols are open standards. Anyone can verify what we do, how we do it, and that we do what we say.

We don't build walled gardens. We build infrastructure that you can leave, fork, or improve. Lock-in is a failure of design.

---

## 4. Technology Should Feel Human

The best technology recedes. It doesn't demand your attention — it serves your intention.

We build tools that feel like conversations, not forms. That respect your pace, not optimize for engagement. That help you think, not think for you. The interface should feel like sitting with a thoughtful friend, not filling out an application.

---

## 5. No Gamification, No Manipulation

We don't use points, badges, streaks, or leaderboards. We don't manufacture urgency. We don't exploit psychological vulnerabilities to drive "engagement."

You are not a user to be retained. You are a person doing important work. We build tools worthy of that work.

---

## 6. Abundance Is the Goal

We believe in positive-sum outcomes. The goal is not to capture value but to create it — and to create systems where value flows back to those who generated it.

When we win, you should win. When you contribute, you should benefit. This is the foundation of an economy that works for everyone.

---

## 7. Verification Through Math

Promises can be broken. Code can be audited. Cryptography can be verified.

We embed our principles into architecture, not just policy. User-derived encryption means we *can't* read your data. On-chain attribution means contributions *can't* be erased. Open source means claims *can* be verified.

Trust, but verify. Then trust less, because verification is built in.

---

## 8. Long-Term Thinking

We're building for generations, not quarters. We refuse venture capital that demands extraction. We choose structures that protect mission over profit.

The easy path is often the wrong path. We choose the hard path when it's the right one.

---

## 9. Join Movements, Don't Recreate Them

We are part of a larger ecosystem fighting for data sovereignty, human dignity, and ethical technology. We don't pretend to have invented these ideas. We build on the work of those who came before and contribute to the movements that share our values.

Solidarity over competition. Contribution over credit.

---

## 10. The Story Is Unfinished

We are living through a hinge in history. AI is arriving. Labor markets are transforming. The future of human contribution is being written now.

We don't know how it ends. But we know what side we're on: the side that believes human contributions matter, that people should own their data, and that technology should serve humanity — not the other way around.

This is not a spectator sport. We're building. Join us.

*These principles are not aspirations. They are commitments — embedded in our architecture, our licensing, and our legal structure. They guide what DreamTree is today and what Value-Tech will become.*
