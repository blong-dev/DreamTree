## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-07 | Project initialized | Created build folder structure |
| 2026-01-07 | Z-index scale finalized | Use layered approach: UI (0-40), overlays (100-400). See below. |
| 2026-01-07 | Colors/fonts confirmed | Design System doc is source of truth (5 backgrounds, 5 fonts) |
| 2026-01-07 | Typing effect: YES | Include character-by-character reveal for DreamTree content. Click to skip. |
| 2026-01-07 | Missing tools: defer | Decide on Skill Sharpening, Mindfulness, Routine, Resume Builder when encountered |
| 2026-01-07 | Connections audit: before Phase 3 | Must map data flows before building tools that depend on hydration |

### Z-Index Scale (Final)

| Layer | Z-Index | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `z-base` | 0 | Default content |
| `z-raised` | 10 | User response bubbles |
| `z-header` | 20 | Breadcrumb bar |
| `z-nav` | 30 | Navigation bar |
| `z-input` | 40 | Input area |
| `z-backdrop` | 100 | Overlay backgrounds |
| `z-overlay` | 200 | TOC panel, tools panel |
| `z-modal` | 300 | Confirmation dialogs |
| `z-tooltip` | 400 | Tooltips, popovers |
