### Introduction

I cannot state enough how impactful today's activities can be, no matter how far along you are in your process. By opening your mind to your own ideas and building neural paths to stimulate and support creativity, you are practicing one of the most highly valued skills in the information economy—**innovation**. The more earnestly you engage with these activities, the more you will get out of the entire process.

### Exercise 2.3.1: New Growth (Idea Trees)

**Purpose:** Generate a wide range of career possibilities through associative brainstorming.

When plants grow, they send out shoots in many directions. They don't reach in every direction, but they give themselves plenty of opportunities, knowing that not all of them will grow into significant parts of the plant.

For this step, you are going to create three idea trees. For each, start with a blank piece of paper and a pen or pencil. The process is simple—don't overthink it. As before, the important thing right now is **quantity**. We, as people, make better choices when we can choose between multiple options. So, keep your judgment to the side as best as you can.

You are going to start with the trunk. Then, add 3-4 branches. Next, each branch gets 3-4 more branches. Finally, one more round of branches. If any of these last ones beg for their own branches, follow your heart and give them some.

Each bunch of branches only needs to be related to its parent branch, not the branches before it, not the other branches, and not the trunk.

**DO NOT CENSOR YOUR IDEAS. ALL IDEAS ARE WELCOME.**

You cannot know if it is a bad idea or a good idea during the exercise; do not pass judgment on any ideas during this stage.

#### Activity 2.3.1a: Idea Tree Creation

**To make your idea trees, read and then follow the directions below:**

1. Get blank pieces of paper.

2. Review the topics or situations which both energize and captivate you (from Exercise 1.3.2: Flow State Mapping), and choose the three which interest and engage you the most for your starting words.

3. Write your first word in the middle of your first piece of blank paper. Circle it. This is your starter. You now have the trunk of your idea tree.

4. Read the word. Write 3-4 words related to your starter. Write the first words you think of. This is your first layer of branches.

5. Read each word in your first layer. Write 3-4 words related to each word in your first layer of branches. Write the first words you think of. This is your second layer of branches.

6. Read each word in your second layer. Write 3-4 words related to each word in your second layer of branches. Write the first words you think of. This is your third layer of branches.

7. If you believe any words from the third layer of branches need branches of their own, write down your ideas.

8. Repeat steps 3-7 for your second and third starting words.

**Starting Words (from your high-flow activities):**

Tree 1: _______________

Tree 2: _______________

Tree 3: _______________

### Exercise 2.3.2: Reading the Leaves

**Purpose:** Transform your idea tree concepts into potential job possibilities.

You are now going to take the ideas you have generated and brainstorm jobs that combine them. This doesn't need to be realistic. The point of this exercise is to practice exploring ideas. **Imagination is the key.** There is no right or wrong answer. Remember, this is only a step on your path; you do not need to have the best ideas in the world, only to practice creating new opportunities.

#### Examples

**Example 1:** Let's say the three ideas I choose from my first idea tree are: dogs, economics, and mountains. I could breed and sell dogs in the mountains. I could start a business for dog and owner retreats in the mountains. I could open a dog kennel with a mountain theme.

**Example 2:** Let's say the three ideas I choose from my second idea tree are: travel, dance, and teaching. I could teach different styles of dance from around the world. I could find and exhibit various forms of dance from around the world on a YouTube channel. I could start a club encouraging the exchange of dance ideas across cultures.

#### Activity 2.3.2a: Combining Ideas into Jobs

You have these three "trees" with all sorts of interconnected ideas on them.

Start with just one tree.

1. Pick three ideas from the outermost layer of branches. Pick them with genuine interest. Which of your ideas captivate you?

2. Think of jobs that combine all three of those ideas.

3. Repeat for each tree.

**Tree 1 Ideas:**
- Idea A:
- Idea B:
- Idea C:
- Possible jobs combining these:




**Tree 2 Ideas:**
- Idea A:
- Idea B:
- Idea C:
- Possible jobs combining these:




**Tree 3 Ideas:**
- Idea A:
- Idea B:
- Idea C:
- Possible jobs combining these:

#### Reflection

It is entirely possible that you just stumbled upon a great idea or even a few great ideas. If that is you, CONGRATULATIONS.

If not, don't worry. Most people don't.

If you found this activity completely pointless, you may want to consider your perspective. The point is not to be right or wrong. The goal is to open up your mind to possibilities. You might not move into these professions, but it is a healthy and beneficial practice.

**The goal is to get used to generating ideas without judgment. Imagination is the essence of creativity; creativity is the basis of innovation.**

### Exercise 2.3.3: Making Choices

**Purpose:** Select three career paths to develop into full plans.

Now you are going to make a few decisions. For some, this will be easy. For others, this will be a painstaking process. Take your time and sincerely consider your options. There is no right answer. The average worker will change jobs more than ten times in their life. Most people completely change careers a couple of times. There are multiple lives that you could live that might bring you joy for years to come. Also, there is no way to know if you will love or hate something until you go out and try it, so don't write anything off just because it sounds silly.

Life is a bit like looking up from the trunk of a tree. Look for the leaves you want to reach, and go that direction. Most paths don't lead straight to the leaves you want; there are many decisions to make between where you are and where you want to go.

**It is time to make some real decisions.**

---

#### Guidelines for Your Three Options

Design and plan three full options for your future. You are not choosing a specific place to work. You are picking a **profession**. Do not consider the actual place of employment—that is not the task. The task is to choose professions.

*Examples: Underwater Welder. High school Spanish teacher. Quality control manager for toy manufacturers.*

You are going to want three options. Life is unpredictable and full of opportunities. Like a tree in nature, the sun does not only shine from one place. There are multiple directions you could grow, and each of them will give you a healthy and robust life. You are not a bamboo shoot—do not limit yourself to only one choice. All people make better decisions when there are a few options on the board.

In Exercise 2.3.2, you came up with a variety of ideas. You should seriously consider those ideas. They were generated from connections to productive activities that make you tick. You might not have found your passion during the activity, but there is a good chance you could become passionate about one of the prospects you imagined.

When making your choices, consider your skills and talents, but keep in mind that you can usually learn more skills than you expect on the job. There are jobs which have strict entrance requirements, like doctors. So, maybe you can't just become a doctor, but there are entire industries which work very closely with doctors and patients, most of which do not require such extensive preparation. Every industry has multiple layers—search for ones that fit your skills and potential. If you have ten years to become a doctor, by all means, go for it; if not, consider becoming a nurse or joining a medical equipment sales team.

More often than not, someone somewhere has taken an unconventional path to realize their dream.⁵ There are many paths—do not judge, doubt, or censor something that stands out in your mind because you cannot see the way at this time.

#### Activity 2.3.3a: Defining Your Three Options

**Option 1: Your First Choice**
The one that meets your real-world needs and utilizes your skills and interests the most. For some, this is a clear and obvious choice—the exercises up to now have only solidified your direction. If that is not you, look back at your ranked lists of skills, consider your work priorities, and weigh them against your compass. Where could life shine the brightest for you? What job could provide you with the most growth? For help answering those questions, discuss your Roots (Part 1) and your New Growth Leaves (Exercise 2.3.1) with some trustworthy people you are close to.

**Career Option 1:**




**Option 2: Your Second Choice**
This would be your first choice if the first one didn't exist. This one should be just as good as the first, but definitively different.

**Career Option 2:**




**Option 3: Your Long Shot**
This would be your choice if there were no restraining factors (no financial needs, no location dependence, no qualification needs, etc.). This is your chance to write down the long shot. Maybe you love the idea but don't think you have a chance at landing that position. Perhaps it is way outside of your current skill set, but you think it would engage you like nothing else ever has. The third is my favorite pick of the three. There are several ways to make significant changes in our lives, and many paths that most people don't see at first.⁵ We will discuss this option more down the road; for now, take the long shot.

**Career Option 3:**
