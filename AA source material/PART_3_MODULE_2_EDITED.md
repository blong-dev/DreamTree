### Introduction

Up to this point, you have been analyzing your capabilities, deciding your trajectory, and preparing the information you are going to use to achieve your dreams. From this module onwards, you will be explicitly chasing those dreams.

**Now the rubber meets the road.**

Today, you will use the information you have gathered to tell your identity story in every reasonable and necessary format. You will, of course, be creating a resume using the descriptors and phrases we have covered so far. You will also be addressing the image that potential employers and contacts will find when they do their research on you—namely, your Facebook profile, LinkedIn, Twitter, and what appears when they Google you.

**You are going to need at least one professionally acceptable photograph:**
- Upper torso, face
- Presentable for your profession
- No alcohol or drugs
- Preferably alone
- Good lighting
- Genuine expression

You need to update every single profile picture you have. They will all show up in a thorough search. You do not need to update your music streaming service with a suit and tie, but it does need to be an acceptable picture. These pictures are the images that people are going to associate with your name. You want it to be professionally flattering.

**You do not need a social media presence. You also do not need to be overly active on social media.** If you are tweeting 200 times a day, when are you working? For our purposes, think of social media as a tool. It should be used to present a carefully crafted image to the world and to engage with and grow your professional and personal networks.

### Exercise 3.2.1: Google Audit

**Purpose:** Ensure your online search results present you professionally.

---

#### Activity 3.2.1a: Search Yourself

1. Open an incognito window in Chrome, or the equivalent in your preferred browser. Google your name. Google your name and city. Google any identifying traits someone might use to find you.

2. For all of the above, you need to scour both the "all" results and the image results. Follow the links to see what people can find about you. It is common to find pictures or websites that have not been used in years. Go through everything you can find and either update the images and the content available or delete the account altogether.

---

#### Activity 3.2.1b: Clean Up Results

3. For any unsavory posts that display you in a less than ideal manner:
   - Untag yourself
   - Ask the original poster to take the photo down
   - Take it down yourself
   - You can contact Google to remove the image, but that is not the best route

4. You might consider trickling more ideal pictures onto your preferred social media network on your own, with family, and through friends. This approach takes time and might not be the best investment right this moment. Extracurricular activities show a well-rounded person. Intoxicated pictures do not.

**Search results reviewed:** ☐

### Exercise 3.2.2: Facebook Update

**Purpose:** Ensure your Facebook profile presents you professionally.

Someone is going to find your Facebook profile. You want it to be presentable. If you have not used Facebook in 10 years, you still have a profile. If you have deleted your profile, you still have a profile. The only time you should not be editing what you have on your Facebook profile is if you have never used the website or application.

---

#### Activity 3.2.2a: Profile Picture Update

1. Update your profile picture. Comb through all your profile pictures. You don't need to show people how drunk you were in college, or the last New Year for that matter. Many people have had Facebook for a decade or more—make sure you are okay presenting your pictures from the past if you are going to keep them. Your photographs tell a story about you; make sure they tell the story you want, and need, them to tell. While you are here, address your cover photo as well.

**Profile picture updated:** ☐  
**Cover photo updated:** ☐  
**Old profile pictures reviewed:** ☐

---

#### Activity 3.2.2b: Privacy Settings

2. Check your privacy settings. Make sure that you are comfortable with them. I suggest that you be comfortable adding professional contacts to your friend list.

**Privacy settings reviewed:** ☐

---

#### Activity 3.2.2c: Content Audit

3. Accounting for your privacy settings and the fact that you will be gaining new friends, edit what you have posted. While political expression is your right, extreme views of any sort can be a turn off for employers, unless of course, you are going to work in politics. Do not engage in bigotry and discrimination. You have every right to have your opinions and feelings, but think carefully about what information you are presenting to your potential employers. Most workplaces are made up of diverse people with differing views—be aware of that fact. The last thing I want is for you to find the perfect job and then be denied an opportunity because your employer is turned off by something you said on Facebook. You can delete posts, and you can set them so that only you can see them. If you do not know how to do those things, use Google to learn how.

**Posts reviewed and cleaned:** ☐

---

#### Activity 3.2.2d: About Section

4. Update your "about" section with a summary of your identity story (from Exercise 2.5.3a).

5. Update your "intro" with a 6-10 word phrase summarizing your identity (from Activity 3.1.2h).

6. Edit the rest of your "about" section to be up to date and accurate. Be intentional about what you choose to share. You do not need to share everything.

**About section updated:** ☐

---

#### Activity 3.2.2e: Photo Review

7. Go through the photographs you are tagged in and the pictures you have posted. Make sure that they are either private or professionally appropriate.

**Tagged photos reviewed:** ☐  
**Posted photos reviewed:** ☐

### Exercise 3.2.3: Resume/CV Creation

**Purpose:** Create a professional resume that tells your story using employer language.

Resume if you are looking in the US, Curriculum Vitae everywhere else.

The role of a resume or CV is twofold. The first job of the resume is to avoid the trash bin. The second is to leave a positive impression on the employer. While you want your resume to represent your story, it is not going to give a complete account of who you are. Many companies use software to filter the tens, hundreds, or thousands of resumes they receive.

---

#### Getting Past Automated Filters

There are two main things that you will do to get past automated filters.

**First:** Use keywords and phrases listed in the job descriptions for those positions (you did this in Exercise 3.1.1). The worker who creates the job post is almost certainly in communication with whoever is setting up the resume filter, and they are looking for the same attributes.

**Second:** Apply to smaller companies. Smaller companies tend to have less competition for open jobs, and therefore, it is easier to stand out from the crowd.

---

#### Resume Guidelines

In Module 3.1, you should have written everything you need to express on your resume. You and I have discussed how to approach your resume. I strongly suggest using a resume template from "Canva" or a website like "Canva." When choosing your template, be sure that it sends the message you want it to send. The layout of your resume is an extension of the story you are telling.

**Do:**
- Use keywords, but do not overstuff your resume with them
- Quantify any work that can be quantified
- Pass the screening first, then engage curiosity
- Lead interviewers into asking about your most significant achievements
- Tell your story
- Be clear and concise
- Write every line in simple tense
- Focus on what you can do
- Use your potential employers' vocabulary

**Don't:**
- Use bland statements that are difficult to prove (everyone is a "hard worker" and everyone is "innovative")
- Include explanations—save those for interviews
- Sell yourself overtly—leave that for interviews
- Focus on the things you cannot do
- Include references

**Show, Don't Tell:**
Rather than expressing your characteristics, use examples that demonstrate those characteristics. You are not a "capable leader"; you "increased team efficiency by 30% in 3 months with human-first management techniques."

---

#### Activity 3.2.3a: Resume Draft

Draft a presentable resume using all the skills you have learned up to this point:
- Tell your story
- Use keywords from job posts
- Describe your skills and experience using quantifiable facts
- Be clear and concise
- Every line should be in simple tense

**This is a draft, an iteration. It is not the final copy.** We will discuss your resume further at our next meeting. Update your resume periodically throughout your life.

No resume is perfect. You are only trying to sell the person who is going to hire you. So, don't be afraid to be you, and be sure to tell your story while relying on facts and figures.

**Resume draft completed:** ☐  
**Template source:**  
**Keywords included:**


---

### Exercise 3.2.4: LinkedIn Optimization

**Purpose:** Create a complete, professional LinkedIn profile that supports your networking efforts.

LinkedIn is an excellent tool for finding opportunities, networking, and engaging in your professional community. You are going to use this tool. If you do not have a LinkedIn profile, create one now and use the following guidelines to set everything up correctly.

Visit your LinkedIn profile. Click on the Edit pencil.

---

#### Activity 3.2.4a: Profile Picture

1. Update your profile picture:
   - Focus the picture on your face, from the shoulders up
   - It needs to be clean and clear
   - Be professionally presentable
   - Set the "visibility" to all LinkedIn members or public

**Profile picture updated:** ☐

**Current position listed:** ☐

#### Activity 3.2.4d: Profile Completion

4. Complete your profile with as much relevant information as you see fit.

5. Return to your profile. In the top right corner, you can edit your public profile and URL. Change your LinkedIn Profile URL to include your full name. If you have a common name, use a common-sense abbreviation.

**Custom URL:** linkedin.com/in/_______________

6. Along the right side of the "edit" screen, adjust the visibility of each of your sections as you see fit. I suggest being as visible as possible. You have nothing to hide, and want to leave good impressions, which requires making some impact.

**Visibility settings adjusted:** ☐

---

#### Activity 3.2.4e: Experience & Education

7. Take the time to input all of your relevant work experience and your education. Use the same language as your resume. Be honest, but be certain to use the keywords you found in job descriptions in Module 3.1. Do not "stuff" keywords—you want the profile to be natural, but targeted.

8. Fill out your education and skills on LinkedIn.

**Work experience added:** ☐  
**Education added:** ☐  
**Skills added:** ☐
