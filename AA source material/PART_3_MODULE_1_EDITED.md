# Part 3: Branches
## Reaching Into the World

---

## Overview

Your roots are where you come from; they make you who you are and give you the foundation to reach towards the sky.

Your trunk is the present—it is the most robust and tangible part of you, where your past meets your future.

The branches above represent all the possible paths that lie in front of you. From the present, each is as likely as the next. You must understand these paths and grow towards your light.

Up to now, you have mapped out three potential futures, written out your story, and iterated your life mission. Again, you are not tied to your mission, but having a clear mission statement will help you to build a clear identity to communicate with potential employers.

From here, you are going to reach out into the world and find your next place of work. I have mentioned before that the traditional method of finding work is not very effective.¹ It is not the most efficient method of hiring from the employer's standpoint, and has a relatively low success rate for employees (around 60% of workers in the United States are dissatisfied with their work).

**You have a lot to do in this part.** In each activity, move quickly. Be confident that you are taking the right steps and take them. Nothing you do here is permanent. There will be activities that might seem incredibly important. I will do my best to point out when you need to complete the task and when you need to dig deep and spend time on something. If you feel as though I am asking you to move quickly through something that deserves more attention, you will almost certainly be revisiting the material later in the program.

I am a firm believer in the idea that there is an excellent job for every person on this planet. When people struggle to find the correct employment, it is generally a result of a lack of understanding of the job market and a complete absence of trial. How can you possibly know that you are going to excel and enjoy something you have never tried? Maybe a job sounds great to you right now, but there is no guarantee that you will be able to withstand, enjoy, or find passion in the day-to-day grind of any position without useful insight.

The few systems set in place which help ease the transition from education to the workforce (internships, apprenticeships, residencies) are inundated with misleading expectations and outside influences.

Rather than following the beaten path, you are going to forge your own.² In almost every profession, there are people who reach their positions in unorthodox ways. They have a cohesive identity story and the grit to chase their dreams.

In this part, you are going to:
- Craft the image that you project into the world
- Find companies who are doing things you are interested in
- Find individuals doing the work you are interested in
- Begin reaching out to those individuals

You are going to exploit human nature to get your foot in the door. Remember, very few jobs are actually obtained through sending resumes, and it is the last place that employers look for quality hires because it has the lowest success rate while being a high-cost and high-risk process.¹ Rather than approaching companies and asking for jobs outright, you are going to approach individuals with genuine curiosity and authenticity.

For clarity, I am not advising you not to apply for jobs, and if you already have interviews lined up, that is still a valuable process.

We will get more into the details as the part goes forward. For now, start by constructing and compiling the content you will project into the world.

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Key Tools:** Job Prospects Spreadsheet (Tab 1)  
**Outputs:**
- Completed job description analysis (2-10 positions)
- Keyword and descriptor inventory
- Resume content drafts
- Professional summary and headline

---

### Introduction

For much of this part, you are going to be using the spreadsheet labeled "Job Prospects." It is designed to help organize all of the information you will be gathering and to help you use it to the greatest effect.

"Job Prospects" has three tabs. The first is best used to build your resume and presentation. You are going to craft your image into one that employers are looking for. To do that, you need to go and find out what exactly employers want and need. Then, reuse the descriptive language in the job posts to describe your characteristics honestly. Use the same adjectives and adverbs in the job descriptions to describe yourself.

When using the spreadsheet, work your way from left to right, and record as much accurate information as possible. Every column has a description embedded in the header. Float your pointer over the top of the column for additional directions and information.

Today you will research the specific way employers describe the position you are interested in, start to get an idea of what problems they need to have solved, and how you are equipped to solve those problems.

Then, you are going to write some content that will prove very useful in Module 3.2. The content does not need to be perfect, but it is important and deserves your full attention. The more you accomplish in this module, the easier the next module will be.

### Exercise 3.1.1: Initial Research

**Purpose:** Analyze job descriptions to understand employer language and requirements.

Start with your first job option (from Exercise 2.3.3), or with the interviews that you have scheduled.

---

#### Activity 3.1.1a: Job Description Collection

1. Find 2-10 job descriptions for your first job option from Part 2. You will see these descriptions on wanted ads and application forms. The most critical descriptions are for the jobs and companies you might be interested in. Unless you already have, **hold off on applying to these positions**—I want you to be more prepared when you approach the companies.

---

#### Activity 3.1.1b: Spreadsheet Documentation

Using the Job Prospects Spreadsheet (Tab 1), record the following for each position:

2. **Career Description** (Column 1) – This is general; it is not the exact job title, but rather the field that the job is in.

3. **Job Title** (Column 2) – Record the exact job title from the job post.

4. **Company Name** (Column 3) – Write the name of the company offering the position.

5. **Job Description** (Column 4) – Copy and paste any relevant parts of the job description.

6. **Adjectives & Adverbs** (Column 5) – Record the adjectives, adverbs, and specific skills that each ad uses.

7. **Your Relevant Experience** (Column 6) – Record all of the relevant experience and skills that you have. Use descriptive language directly from the job description. You will combine these with the descriptive language from your roots in Part 1 soon. For now, use the language in each post.

8. **Skills You Lack** (Column 7) – Record the skills and experience that are called for which you do not have. More often than not, the person writing the job post is listing all of the strengths of the last employee and asking for the next person to be strong in all of their weaknesses as well. Of course, they are also probably looking to spend less money. Quite often, they are asking for more than is reasonable in the job post. There are plenty of ways to deal with these hurdles, and you will. For now, record what you lack.

9. **Story Fit** (Column 8) – Describe how this job fits into your story. What intangibles do you bring to the table? How can you solve the problems that this company faces better than anyone else? How would this particular position at this specific place of work fit into your overall story? You will further develop these ideas later on. For now, focus on finding an honest answer and moving on. Do not waste a ton of time on this part of the task. If it doesn't fit, or if you are not sure, that is okay. We have not done the thorough research needed to know if this place of work will be the best fit for you, so do not stress the details here and now. Get something written, and keep moving.

That is all you need to record into the spreadsheet for now. We will come back for the "Potential Employers" tab and the "Networking" tab later in this part.

### Exercise 3.1.2: Writing Your Content

**Purpose:** Rewrite your qualifications using employer language to create compelling professional content.

For this section, you will be rewriting your roots with the specific intention of relaying your skills and experiences to employers. Use the descriptive language from the job descriptions found in Exercise 3.1.1.

---

#### Activity 3.1.2a: Keyword Identification

1. What descriptive language stands out as universal or commonly used in the job descriptions from Exercise 3.1.1?




2. Which descriptors stand out to you as being the best, while also describing you, your experience, or your skills, in a healthy positive light?




---

#### Activity 3.1.2b: Credibility Inventory

3. Look back through your roots (Part 1), and record everything you have done that supports your credible claim to the position you are seeking.




4. Prioritize these skills and experiences according to how important they are to your successful execution of the tasks described in the job description. Use the Ranking Grid if you need to.




---

#### Activity 3.1.2c: Job Title Definition

5. What would be the title of the job that you want most?




6. Are there any keywords or phrases you think you should use in this job title?




---

#### Activity 3.1.2d: Credential Rewriting

7. Rewrite your credible traits using these guidelines:

   a) Simple past & simple present tense
   b) Phrases, not sentences – start with an active verb; the subject is assumed to be you
   c) Contain roughly one keyword (from job descriptions)
   d) Are quantifiable whenever possible

**Examples:**
- Developed software which increased sales team efficiency by 6%
- Grew publication reach from 5,000 readers per month to 20,000 readers per month in the first six months
- Maintained function of 458 machine units for five years with 0 significant failures

**Your rewritten credentials:**

#### Activity 3.1.2e: Professional Summary

8. Write a short (3-5 sentences) summary of your experience. This summary should draw on your roots and how well the position fits into your identity story. Your aim is for the position to seem as though it is the next logical step in your story.










---

#### Activity 3.1.2f: Value Proposition

9. In 10 words or less, explain why you are the perfect fit for this job and career.






---

#### Activity 3.1.2g: Professional Bio

10. Summarize your identity story and professional achievements in 2-3 sentences.





---

#### Activity 3.1.2h: Headline Creation

### Module 3.1 Footnotes

1. Bolles, Richard N. *What Color Is Your Parachute? A Practical Manual for Job-Hunters and Career-Changers.* Berkeley: Ten Speed Press. Bolles's research consistently demonstrates that traditional application methods (resume submission, job boards) have significantly lower success rates than networking and informational interviewing approaches.

2. Banayan, Alex. *The Third Door: The Wild Quest to Uncover How the World's Most Successful People Launched Their Careers.* New York: Currency, 2018. Banayan's research reveals that successful people often find unconventional paths—"the third door"—rather than following traditional routes.
