### Introduction

There are many things which are outside of our control in life. It is best if we let them be. Accept them as they are and work around them. I am not saying that we should not fight injustices or work to right the wrongs in the world. Quite the contrary, we should understand what cannot be changed so that we may be productive in our efforts to support our values.

For example, there is bias and discrimination in most hiring processes. While these issues do need to be addressed and rectified, we would be foolish to act as though they do not exist.

#### Two Approaches to Finding Work

There are two main approaches to finding the next job.

**The first** is the one you likely know: write your resume, find a job opening, apply to every position you can with your carefully crafted documents, wait in the dark, then (if you're super lucky) you might get an email initiating the interview process. The first interviews are screening; the employer is just looking for reasons to narrow down the list. The final interview is when you get the chance to build a bond and sell yourself as an actual human who brings more to the table than a list of skills.

There are a TON of reasons this doesn't work, but the important thing is, for all intents and purposes, **this doesn't work**.³ Incentives are misaligned at every step of this process. For example, you are not a list of skills; the person writing job descriptions is either looking for the person who just left (with none of the downside) or doesn't fully understand what the position calls for. The process makes it incredibly challenging to showcase or find qualities which genuinely predict success. Meanwhile, it's often a charade because the position has already been filled through the second method.

**The second** one is the one that works: **networking**.³ I am not here to debate the ethics of this, only to share the reality of it. Most employers look inside their organization first, then they either target people they have found or already know, or they defer to people who are referred by trustworthy workers within the organization. Employers around the world have found that this is the surest way to find good hires. So, this is the method we use.

### Exercise 2.2.1: Creator's Mentality

**Purpose:** Internalize the five designer mindsets through character study and personal reflection.

Rather than waiting for the perfect job to fall into your lap, you are going to create your own opportunity. The best way to create opportunity is to have a plan and to live the five mindsets.¹

---

#### The Five Designer Mindsets¹

**Curiosity** – Be curious. You are going to be speaking to people. People love to feel interesting. Being genuinely interested in the people you are talking to will make every interaction you have a more positive one. Further, if you are genuinely curious about the people you are speaking with, then you are more likely to be talking to the right people. Research is professional curiosity. Discovery is what comes from curiosity. Be curious. Do all your research, then find more questions to answer. Curiosity is the spirit of authentic connections. The best, and most effective, networking is authentic.

**Bias to action** – When it is time, take action. When in doubt, take action. You can research and postulate and imagine all day every day. A certain amount of preparation is good and necessary, but preparation has diminishing returns. Sooner rather than later, you need to go out and take action on your postulations. Make a hypothesis, test your hypothesis, observe the effects, iterate, and improve. We can only truly learn through action.

**Reframing** – Otherwise known as a change of perspective. Some problems are insurmountable. Most problems are opportunities. Learning to see obstacles as opportunities will pay dividends in all aspects of life. An example:

*Before:* "I have applied to every job I qualify for, and none of them are answering me. I will never find a job."

*After:* "I have tried applying for jobs using traditional methods. I need to change how I am looking for a job."

**Awareness** – The human brain is always looking for ways to optimize. Think of your daily commute. While you are on your commute, you probably do not notice much of what is going on around you, unless it is extraordinary. The very first time you took the commute was likely a small adventure, fraught with new stimuli, and the excitement of your new job ahead. Now that you have made the trip so many times, your brain does not waste the energy it takes to observe every little thing—it assumes you know what is essential and only pays attention to those things. Attention is a trillion-dollar business; companies spend a tremendous amount on advertising; the entertainment industry is massive. Know the difference between awareness and distraction. The more aware you are of what is going on around you, the more likely you are to recognize opportunity when it comes. Not everything that glitters is gold. Awareness means knowing the difference.

**Radical collaboration** – People. Know that everything in the world of work and creation is made up of people. Every institution, every group, everything, is made up of people. The most abundant resource you have is not the internet. It is the people you know. Don't be afraid to tap into the genius and perspective around you. Flow is when an individual performs at an extremely high level. Yet, no individual can accomplish what a group working together can. Every potential job will have gatekeepers; secretaries, HR representatives, hiring managers, and future co-workers are all people. Each interview is a two-way conversation. You are working together to find out if you can work well together.

#### Activity 2.2.1a: Mindset Character Profiles

1. Find a character from a book, series, movie, or real life for each mindset. The mindset should be that character's defining quality.

| Mindset | Character | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Curiosity | | |
| Bias to Action | | |
| Reframing | | |
| Awareness | | |
| Radical Collaboration | | |

2. Defend your choices. Explain how and why these characters exemplify the mindset. Give examples.


3. What does embodying the mindset help the character to accomplish?

### Exercise 2.2.2: Action Triggers

**Purpose:** Define your goals, confront your fears, and develop strategies for action.

#### Eight Principles for Action

1. Focus on the task at hand. *The one who chases two rabbits catches none.*
2. Use the skills you have, not the ones you don't. *A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.*
3. Find your inspiration. Reproduce or create your most successful scenarios.
4. Set your intentions and follow through.
5. Aim for the moon; if you miss, you'll land in the stars.
6. Embrace fear. Get comfortable being uncomfortable. Move through fear into the unknown.
7. Take massive action. Hypothesize, act, observe, adjust, iterate.
8. Persevere. Be relentless.⁴ Never stop. *Remember that the tortoise beats the hare.*

---

#### Activity 2.2.2a: Defining Success

I want you to aim for the moon. So, now, define your "moon." Be specific. How much wealth? How much income? What material desires? What organizations, businesses, or non-profits need to exist? What connections do you need to make? Dream it all, and write it all down here.

1. What do you need to survive?


2. How would a comfortable life for you look?


3. What does happiness mean to you?


4. What is your definition of success?


5. If you had three wishes, what would they be?


6. Describe your dream life.


7. What are you willing to do to achieve your standards?


---

#### Activity 2.2.2b: Confronting Fear

8. What strikes fear into your bones?


9. Detail some actions you think you could take to conquer those fears.


10. What situation over the next year are you afraid of failing?


11. Give three opportunistic perspectives on that situation. (Practice reframing)


12. Brainstorm actions you could take to excel in that situation.


---

#### Activity 2.2.2c: Building on Past Success

13. Describe a time you overcame your fear.


14. Have you ever had an authority figure who motivated you? What about that person motivated you?


---

#### Activity 2.2.2d: Resilience Planning

15. What is the worst possible situation you can accept for your life?


16. Describe the last time you were down. (Financially, emotionally, in performance—you choose your frame)


17. What did you do to improve your situation?


18. What could you have done better?

### Exercise 2.2.3: Reframing Failure

**Purpose:** Transform failures into growth opportunities through systematic reflection.

Failure is no longer an end. Life is not a pass or fail test. Sometimes, things do not work the way we expect. So, either change what you expect or change the way it works. Reframing failure is an extension of being mindful.

---

#### Activity 2.2.3a: Failure Log & Reframe (Ongoing)

1. Using the Reframing Failure Worksheet (see Resources), look back over the last week (or month or year), and log your failures.

2. Label them as screwups, weaknesses, or growth opportunities.

3. Reframe each as an opportunity for growth.

4. **Repeat at the end of each week** to build the habit of reflection and growth.

---

#### Understanding the Reframing Process

Often, life is a numbers game. If you try enough times, eventually something will work. You need to go a step beyond random trials. Record your mishaps, reflect on them, and adjust your behavior accordingly. **Do not fail the same way twice.** Learn from science, pay close attention to all the variables involved. Failure is not an end; it is a means to learn.

Practice reframing in your daily life. Change your perspective to see opportunity in every instance:

- Lost your keys? → Memory exercise
- Family argument? → Practice diplomacy, communication, and negotiation
- Not enough time? → Streamline for efficiency

Decide to view the world from a place of possibility by repeatedly choosing perspectives which are acceptable to you. Practicing mindfulness—pausing to take a few deep breaths and settling your mind—will help you to see aspects of any situation which you might otherwise overlook.
