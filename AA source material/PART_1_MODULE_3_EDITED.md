### Exercise 1.3.1: Work Factor Prioritization

**Purpose:** Establish your personal hierarchy of work factors to guide career decisions.

Before we move on, you need to prioritize your work factors from Modules 1.1 & 1.2. Use the Ranking Grid (see Resources).

When considering employment, what is most important to you?

**The Five Work Factors:**

- **Compensation** – how much money you earn, benefits, and bonus structure
- **Environment** – where in the world you live and the make-up of your office
- **Skills** – being able to use the skills you have or learn new skills
- **Knowledges** – being able to excel in your field of interest or expertise
- **People** – getting along with the people you work with and for

#### Activity 1.3.1a: Five-Factor Ranking

Rank your work factors from most important (1) to least important (5):

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

### Exercise 1.3.2: Flow State Mapping

**Purpose:** Identify activities and conditions that produce your optimal performance state.

You have documented all of your work factors and have thought about what is most important to you.

Now, I want you to recall the time when you were the most present. For this step, you will reflect upon your past experiences to get a sense of how they affected you and your fundamental motivation. I am talking about the studied and admired sensation of flow.

Human beings are hardwired to experience flow. During states of flow, people are upwards of 500% more effective or productive doing their work.⁸ In short, the body achieves this by turning off the prefrontal cortex, effectively allowing the brain to remove criticism and doubt, exist deeply in the present moment, make more lateral connections between new and old information, and innovate upon those newly created ideas seamlessly. The state is often described by the feeling of brilliant information flowing out of the subject, connecting one moment seamlessly to the next.

Everyone experiences flow from time to time; the most brilliant among us learn to use it to their advantage. You can increase your chances of flow by practicing mindful paced breathing. There are several books and entire businesses built around that fact, so I will spare you the details for now. Practice breathing evenly ("hoooooooooooo", not "ho ho ho ho ho ho ho") and in rhythm (try in for 5, out for 5). You may have been taught to breathe from your gut, but I want you to breathe from the core of your chest, more specifically your heart. Your heart is the generator of your body, and everything adapts around it, a concept called entrainment, so breathe from your core. Steady breath will help your heart beat more regularly, which will entrain the rest of your body to the same rhythm. When your body is all in rhythm, it resonates, creating a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. Practice breathing to increase your vitality and the amount of time you are in flow.

There is a great deal of research about the idea of "flow."⁸ Every expertise has its own word to describe the state; most people recognize "in the zone." Flow is often achieved when someone is pushed to their extreme limits after preparation. These are times when all of our skills and expertise are called upon, we shut out everything except the task at hand, and we execute on a very high level. Symptoms of flow include time distortion, being oblivious to anything other than the task, euphoria, extreme productivity, creative ease, and a sense of singular focus. If you have ever amazed yourself with what you could do or you accomplished something that did not seem possible at the start, you were probably experiencing flow.

Flow is similar to a sense of ecstasy, but ecstasy is more closely related to play than work. Ecstasy describes also being singular in mind and focus, being exactly where and when you are, but it refers to elation and bliss rather than accomplishment and execution. Some professionals differentiate between what we get joy from and the work that we do. The best way to live life is to align the two, just like our life values and our work values. Ecstasy is pure happiness, pure energy. Flow is the essence of the creative state. Physiologically, the two are more or less the same; these extreme mental states are characterized by a flood of powerful neurotransmitters.

#### Understanding the Flow Tracking System⁹

Separate flow into **focus** and **energy** for the purpose of picking your brain during this activity.

- Think of **focus** as being the scale between boring and captivating.
- Think of **energy** as being the scale between draining and energizing.

**When you are fully engaged and completely energized by a task, you are experiencing flow.**

**Example:** Stacy is a journalist who reported a huge corruption case a few years back. While doing the background research was a bit draining, she remembers being extremely focused. Then, there was one day when the whole story came together and she knew it was big. Once she had done her research, she spread out all her findings one night to try to crack the case. She can't quite say how she connected the dots—the memory is a bit blurry—but everything lined up for her as if she already knew all the answers; that was flow.

**For the following activities, you will need the worksheet titled "Flow Tracking" (see Resources)**

The document must be printed for the greatest effect. You may want to print several copies front and back.

You may absolutely fashion your own version of the worksheet by hand or create your own document. No matter what path you take, be certain to complete each of the steps.

**How to use the Flow Tracking Worksheet:**
1. Name the activity
2. Provide a very short description of the activity
3. Use the table on the right to mark your energy and focus level, coloring in each box below your mark
4. If you were in flow during the activity, write "flow" and circle it

#### Activity 1.3.2a: Memorable Past Flow Analysis

1. Recall all the significant events you have recorded in Modules 1.1 and 1.2. For each event, assign two scores: one for focus and one for energy.

   The most significant events, when you experienced flow, deserve more attention. Mark those events with the word "Flow."
   
   **Energy:** draining (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) energizing  
   **Focus:** boring (v, w, x, y, z) captivating
   
   **Example:** For Stacy, researching her case was a (-1, z) while the night of creative problem solving was (2, z) and induced flow.


2. Record your top 5-10 most focused activities on the Flow Tracking worksheet.


3. Record your top 5-10 most energizing activities on the Flow Tracking worksheet.


4. Is there any activity, task, or skill which you find both highly energizing and highly captivating?

#### Activity 1.3.2b: Recent Past Flow Tracking

Recall the past 3-10 days. (The more you do, the stronger the tool will be.)

1. Record every significant activity of each day on the Flow Tracking worksheet.

2. Write a short description of each activity on the lines provided.

3. Shade the boxes according to the energy and focus of the activity.

4. Are there any activities which you find both highly energizing and highly captivating?

#### Activity 1.3.2c: Present Flow Tracking (Ongoing)

**Repeat this process at the end of each day. Continue until Part 3 is complete.**

1. Record every significant activity of the day on the Flow Tracking worksheet.

2. Write a short description of each activity on the lines provided.

3. Shade the boxes according to the energy and captivation of the activity.

4. Are there any activities which you find both highly energizing and highly captivating?

*Note: This ongoing practice will provide crucial data for Module 2.3 (Landmarking) when you create your idea trees based on high-engagement activities.*

### Module 1.3 Footnotes

8. Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly. *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.* New York: Harper & Row, 1990. Csikszentmihalyi's research established the scientific foundation for understanding flow states and their impact on performance and well-being.

9. Flow Tracking Methodology is an original tool created by Braedon Long for this program, adapted from Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory. The energy/focus matrix provides a practical way to identify activities that produce optimal engagement.
