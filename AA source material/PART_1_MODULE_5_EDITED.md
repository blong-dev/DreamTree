### Introduction

We will focus on mental health. Physical and spiritual health are both important, but I feel it is best for you to find answers to questions you may have about those topics from another source. People from all walks of life can benefit from mental health practices.

I am going to address three aspects of mental health: **achievement**, **fortitude**, and **emotional intelligence**.

In all three, the lesson is discipline and practice. The goal is not perfection. The goal is active practice.

Bill Burnett describes five mindsets which are imperative to our cause: **curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration**.¹ Mastering these mindsets and living them will lead you to opportunity.

### Exercise 1.5.1: Skill Sharpening Practice

**Purpose:** Commit to daily improvement of a skill that sets you apart.

Achievement is characterized by the things that we can do—otherwise known as our skills. In previous modules, we described our skills, our mastery over them, whether they give or take energy from us, and how captivated we are by them.

Whether it is for our own pleasure, to further our working cause, or to give us a competitive edge, it is crucial to be a student of life, for life. Everybody should always be improving themselves in one way or another.

The post-industrial economy is based on specialization. Pick a transferable skill or a knowledge which sets you apart from others—an expertise. If you do not have one, it is your duty to make one of your skills an expertise.

Additional practice, above and beyond what is needed for any of the work that you do, is self-improvement for the sake of self-improvement. Sharpen your skills to make you a better candidate than your competition.

**You will want to start as soon as possible. Today is best; right now is even better.**

#### Activity 1.5.1a: Skill Selection

1. Choose a skill to practice. (Review your top skills from Exercise 1.1.1e and your flow activities from Exercise 1.3.2)

   Selected skill:


---

#### Activity 1.5.1b: Daily Practice Commitment (Ongoing)

2. Dedicate at least 15 minutes of singular focus to improving that skill every single day.

3. Practice the skill every single day. Don't stop.

4. If you grow tired of practicing this skill, reach a level of mastery, or otherwise need a change, choose another skill and repeat the process. This is the never-ending task of self-betterment.

### Exercise 1.5.2: Grit Development

**Purpose:** Develop mental fortitude and personal accountability.

Grit describes the mental fortitude to work tirelessly for rewards which are either abstract or far removed, often both.¹¹ I am a proponent of working smarter, not harder, but there is no replacement for diligence, perseverance, and drive. You absolutely must take yourself seriously. Even if your profession is in comedy, be a comic, not a joke.

To get this message across, I have decided to share a personal story.

#### Take Yourself Seriously

On April 1st, 2016, I woke up at 3 pm. I had slept through two strategy meetings, an interview, training, and was supposed to be getting ready to go out knocking doors for the next 5 hours. I called my campaign director; she was furious, but more, she was sad.

Four months ago she had put her name on the line to bring me in to direct a field canvass that had, until that point, no direction and no hope. Enthusiastic and passionate, I left everything else behind to join her. We had been working 60+ hours each week to get going and had finally started to gain some momentum.

Tuesday, March 31st, we went to dinner and then to a local bar to watch some music. Long after my co-worker went home, I was the last patron in the bar, finishing something past my 20th drink, around 4 am. I had promised to be at work by 8:30. I had told myself before dinner that I would have two beers and be at work early, hoping for 8, thinking it would probably be 8:15.

I woke up in severe pain which had become all too common. I couldn't open my eyes. An attempt to stand was met with icy hot needles in my brain; I collapsed. Watching my drool inch across the hardwood, I considered the remedy I had taken for what was becoming countless days prior; I longed for the rye whiskey on my window sill.

I remembered the promises I had made: to my co-workers, to my employees, to the people who depended on me. I remembered the times I had been sent to the hospital for alcohol poisoning, and all the promises I had made to my Mother. I called Alex, who had done so much for me already, and told her I wasn't going to make it to work that day. No way.

That is when I realized that nothing I said mattered. Every promise I had made, I was breaking it. Both the spoken and the unspoken. Here I was, doing what I wanted to do, and throwing it all away. I wallowed for a bit on all the people I was letting down. But I had done that before. It got me nowhere. I thought about slowing drinking, but I had tried who knows how many times—hell, just last night was supposed to be slow.

When I finally pulled my face off the floor and crawled to the sink, I knew I had to do something I hadn't ever done before. I stared myself in the eyes, unsure of what would happen next. That's when I knew. **I had to take myself seriously.**

I had dreams, ambitions, goals, and more. Yet so far, I had let those sit idly by while I did as I pleased. No more. I told myself I would never drink again. I told myself that it was just the start. I made a promise to myself which I live by to this day. I promised accountability. Whatever challenge should come, I vowed to face it. I vowed to overcome. I promised to be the person I knew I was meant to be.

That day wasn't the first time I had made promises to myself. So, I vowed to take myself seriously. I can still see my face. The most resolute I had ever been, and terrified of what was to come. In those eyes I see relief. Finally, I was going to take myself seriously, and no one could stop me.

Since that day, my entire life has changed. I have been and am sober. I quit smoking. I revolutionized my diet. I started working out regularly. I have found time for my spirituality. I fell in love. I moved to another continent. I started a business. **I take myself seriously.**

Overcoming addiction, changing your life, creating your story, standing up for yourself, surmounting your fears, starting your next project, building your dreams—no matter what you plan on doing next, **TAKE YOURSELF SERIOUSLY**. Every day. Never stop. This is grit.¹¹ Daily sacrifice for long-term gain.

I don't mean to wear nice clothes and look people in the eye (although those are useful habits for networking). I mean, look yourself in the mirror and hold yourself accountable. Every single day. No one else can tell you what you need to do. No one else can do the things you need to do. I am giving you all the help you need to live a more fulfilled life. The rest is up to you. You are your greatest enemy and your greatest ally. Choose to be your ally. Every day. No matter how hard it is. Don't lie to yourself—you'll know. Take yourself seriously.

**Do the things you know you need to do.**

Be relentless.¹²

#### Activity 1.5.2a: Role Model Identification

1. Who do you look up to? Who is your role model? Why?


2. What about that person (those people) do you admire? What characteristics do they have that you don't?


---

#### Activity 1.5.2b: Habit Assessment

3. What are the bad habits you need to quit?


4. What are the good habits you need to start?


---

#### Activity 1.5.2c: Promise Keeping

5. What promises do you need to keep? To yourself? To those you care about?


6. What has stopped you from keeping those promises?


---

#### Activity 1.5.2d: Accountability Practice

7. Choose an order to accomplish these. If you need, start with the easy ones and work up. No matter what, choose one to complete as soon as you possibly can. Start building active trust in yourself.


8. Forgive yourself when you mess up. If you fall off the horse, focus on getting back on the horse, not on the fact that you fell off. Forgive. Take yourself seriously—if you don't, who will? Next.

### Exercise 1.5.3: Mindfulness Practice

**Purpose:** Develop mental discipline through daily mindfulness practice.

Mindfulness is rooted in the eastern practice of meditation. I am not asking you to chant mantras or do yoga unless that is what you want to do. What I am talking about is discipline for your mind. Silencing your mind is difficult. Try thinking about nothing for the next 5 minutes.

...

Too hard? How about only thinking about your breath for the next 2 minutes.

...

How did you do? Did your mind wander? It is okay if it did. The important thing is practicing the act of coming back to silence. Practice batting down thoughts and distractions. The world is more distracting today than it ever has been. Grabbing attention is a trillion-dollar business.

So, why is this important? I am glad you asked.

Your brain is just like every other muscle; the parts you exercise get stronger. Mindfulness uses emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is otherwise known as keeping a level head in the face of animosity. Psychologists have shown this works, neurologists agree, and some cultures have been practicing this basic technique for thousands of years.

Training your brain to focus, to stay calm, and to shut out distractions will improve your soft skills, make you more able to communicate with others, improve your mental energy, and make you generally grittier.

You can spend as much or as little time on this as you think necessary. I highly suggest taking it seriously.

---

#### Activity 1.5.3a: Daily Mindfulness Setup

Spend between 5 and 20 minutes a day practicing mindfulness. Focus on your breath. Push out all distractions. Silence your inner voice for a period each and every day.

Some people do this while completing thoughtless tasks, but it is most effective when practiced on its own. Do what works best for you.

**My mindfulness commitment:**
- Time of day:
- Duration:
- Location:

### Exercise 1.5.4: Routine Establishment

**Purpose:** Create an intentional daily routine that incorporates all your new practices.

Routine is the final point of this module. A routine is the manifestation of discipline. Whether you realize it or not, you have a routine. Humans are creatures of habit, and that will never change.

My task for you is to consider your routine intentionally. Do you wander through your day from one thing to the next? Or is there a method to your day?

Either way, this part has given you at least three tasks which demand your attention every day:

1. **Flow Tracking** (from Exercise 1.3.2c) – tracking your daily activities, how they affect your energy, and how engaged you are in them

2. **Skill Sharpening** (from Exercise 1.5.1b) – choosing a useful and enjoyable skill to hone, practice, and sharpen as a way to stand out from your peers and, more importantly, to better yourself

3. **Mindfulness** (from Exercise 1.5.3a) – set aside a short amount of time to practice quieting your mind each day

Finally, remember the five mindsets every day:¹

- **Curiosity**
- **Bias to action**
- **Reframing**
- **Awareness**
- **Radical collaboration**

---

#### Activity 1.5.4a: Routine Design

I have provided you with a daily schedule to help you accomplish and keep track of these tasks.

Use the "Routine" template (see Resources). It takes about five weeks to break old habits and build new ones. If you start now, exercising your brain will become a part of your daily routine before you finish the course.

**Design your daily routine here:**

Morning:


Midday:


Evening:

### Module 1.5 Footnotes

1. Burnett, Bill, and Dave Evans. *Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life.* New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2016. The five designer mindsets (curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, radical collaboration) provide the mental framework for approaching career design and life changes.

11. Duckworth, Angela. *Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.* New York: Scribner, 2016. Duckworth's research demonstrates that grit—the combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals—is a stronger predictor of success than talent alone.

12. Grover, Tim S., with Shari Wenk. *Relentless: From Good to Great to Unstoppable.* New York: Scribner, 2013. Grover's work on mental toughness and relentless commitment informs the "take yourself seriously" philosophy central to this module.
