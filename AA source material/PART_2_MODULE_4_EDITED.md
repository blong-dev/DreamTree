### Exercise 2.4.3: Unknowns Identification

**Purpose:** Articulate the questions you need to answer as you pursue each path.

It is crucial that you approach your future with genuine curiosity. You need to have some questions you are seeking answers to as you move down any path in life. I have given you some starting points, but these do not need to be your questions. Write 2-5 good questions for each option.

**Consider:**
- What is uncertain?
- What will you need to learn to be successful on this path?
- What ideas or realities will you explore on this path?
- What are you going to learn from pursuing this path?
