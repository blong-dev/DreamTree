### Introduction

To finish this part, you will be constructing your story. You have analyzed your past, identified your compass, and laid out three potential futures. Now, it is time to connect the dots and form a cohesive and coherent story which presents you in the best and most accurate light possible.

If you are not entirely satisfied with what you think your story is, then you are not looking at it in the right light. **Every single person has a good story to tell**—seeing and understanding yours is a matter of perspective and construction.

First, you will aim for a certain level of competency—are you looking to run a corporation, or are you hoping to work on a design team? There is no right answer in the first section, but it is important that you and I both understand where you are aiming.

Then you will learn the basics of persuasive storytelling. Not only do you want to tell your story, but you want that story to convince your audience of something—particularly that you are fantastic and will accomplish the goals that you have set out.

The last thing you need to do is write a full draft of your story. Shape and record the story that you tell yourself. It should be positive, accurate, follow your "light," and convince even your harshest critics that you are an impressive individual (according to your needs). From this story, you will construct your elevator pitch and decipher the best ways to approach your upcoming interviews. Weave together all the pieces of your life and learn to present your story as the masterpiece it is.

### Exercise 2.5.1: Choosing Your Level

**Purpose:** Identify your target professional level to guide your story and presentation.

The purpose of this exercise is to determine the level of business you are targeting. Are you an executive who enjoys the big picture, or are you best served dealing with your own needs? Not one of these is notably better than the other, but each level does have different responsibilities requiring different preparation. While it can be difficult to pigeonhole some real-world roles into particular categories, you should do your best to identify which level you are the most prepared for.

#### The Five Competency Levels¹⁰

**Level 1** is typically associated with jobs such as Assistants, Secretaries, Technicians, and Operators.

**Level 2** is typically associated with jobs such as Statisticians, Corporate Management and Administration Assistants/Officers, Logistics Officers, Engineers, and Documentation specialists.

**Level 3** is typically associated with jobs such as Economists, Policy Analysts, IT Analysts, Developers, and HR Advisers.

**Level 4** is typically associated with jobs such as Senior Economists, Senior Analysts, Leads, or Managers.

**Level 5** is typically associated with jobs such as Heads of Division, Counsellors, Deputy Directors, C-level Officers, and Directors.

#### Activity 2.5.1a: Level Identification

Your specific role may not be listed. If that is the case, make the best estimation you can, based on the examples given.

Once you have estimated your level, see the Competency Framework (in Resources)¹⁰ and read through the qualifications for your level.

If you are unclear on some of the objectives, that is okay. Be as confident as possible that most of them are accurate for you. We will discuss this first thing at our next meeting.

Adjust your estimated level accordingly. You will want to be able to demonstrate ability, success, or excellence for each point associated with your level.

**My target level:** ___

**Competencies I can demonstrate:**


**Competencies I need to develop:**

### Exercise 2.5.2: Persuasive Storytelling

**Purpose:** Learn the four elements of compelling professional storytelling.

---

#### Element 1: Motive (The "Why")

The first thing to understand when crafting a persuasive story is the "why." Why are you telling this story? Storytelling is an ancient art passed down for thousands of generations. According to some sociologists, it is a fundamental building block of humanity, a building block of society.

In more relevant terms, a story is the most effective way to communicate any complex ideas. Coming out and telling your prospective boss that you are a hard worker is lame and ineffective. Rather than touting your accomplishments, put your audience in your shoes, appeal to their empathy, make them feel what you felt from your point of view, and lead them to the conclusions you want.

By nature, humans identify patterns. As a result of our evolution, we design all sorts of algorithms to help us save time and energy. Most people assume (unconsciously or consciously) that microcosms reflect macrocosms. In fact, that is the basis of the entire traditional interview process. We boil down our lives to one piece of paper for employers to screen for a 15-minute interaction where both parties make life-altering decisions with consequences which play out over several years.

**A single well-told and well-chosen story will give your audience a firm idea of who you are, what your morals are, what you stand for, and how worthy of their time and resources you are.** The interview process is essentially the employer's attempt to find and understand your story in the most efficient manner possible. Our job is to craft an honest story that leads them to the conclusions we need them to find.

The key to a good story is **authenticity**. Accounts that are relatable and real are the most impressionable. Being liked is not your job; your responsibility is to demonstrate your character. While you should consider your audience (their needs, desires, etc.—we will cover this more later), your main goal is to demonstrate who you are. Respect is much more powerful than being liked. If you are not a good fit but they like you, then maybe you are offered a job that is not good for you. If you are not a good fit but they respect you, then perhaps you are given a referral to a job that will be the perfect fit.

Be who you are, not whom you think you are supposed to be. Refer back to your compass, your light (Exercise 2.1.3). You want your story to demonstrate coherence. You do not need to have been following some mystical compass or to have known your passion throughout your life for this to be effective, accurate, and authentic. Your mission is to craft a storyline that makes sense of the events in your life while showing some commitment to your internal compass.

**Your message, your values, your actions, and your direction in life should all resonate together as one.** Among other things, this will help your story to be more complete, and therefore, easier for the audience to comprehend.

---

#### Activity 2.5.2a: Motive Clarification

What do you want to achieve by telling your story?




---

#### Element 2: Purpose (Your Theme)

The second big step is to identify your purpose. A life with purpose is a life worth living.⁹ You are telling this story to relay your life mission and your constitution to your audience. So, the more precise and authentic your purpose is, the more compelling your story will be.

Take a look at your life, the work you have done, and all you have accomplished. What themes tie all of them together? If you are struggling for a clear answer, reflect on the activities you have completed before this for help.

Reflect upon your roots (Part 1) and your value compass (Exercise 2.1.3). Consider your life values and your work values—the theme you want to identify is one that draws a line between the two. No one is perfect, so remember that you are a work in progress. Be forgiving of your faults and allow yourself to see your best qualities.

You might come up with things like "pursuit of excellence," "multicultural understanding," or "scientific innovation." When I did this exercise, I found "economic justice," "improved education," and "growth through dialogue."

Your purpose might be money, sports, wealth, legacy, environment, fighting poverty, sobriety, religion, exploration, security, stability, or anything else imaginable. It does not matter what it is, only that you identify one as clearly as possible.

**This decision is not permanent.** In fact, it is perfectly okay and normal to change direction, to shift the meaning you find in life. You might accomplish your goals, find a greater purpose, or completely lose interest. That is all perfectly okay. Today, your job is to identify a mission, a message to build your story around. It does not have to be your campaign until the end of time, but it does need to make sense in the context of your life. The more your current "life's meaning" resonates with all the parts of your past, the stronger your story will be.

The theme you identify should have meaning to you. You may find it inspiring, and you might be extremely passionate about the subject you identify. You might not. At the very least, the theme needs to make sense to you. If it does not make sense to you, it won't make sense to anyone else.

Finding clarity in your purpose serves you in many ways. First of all, and maybe most importantly, is that it is easier to live a happy life when you believe your life has meaning. The meaning gives you direction and will make difficult decisions easier. Reflect upon your compass from Module 2.1; attempt to peer up and down your path to see where you have been, where you are going, and the ideas that tie the aggregate of past, present, and immediate future you, together.

Think of yourself as a character in a story. Take an outside view of your life and do your best to describe your character. Do not expect to find the perfect answer. Strive to find a plot, a few explanations, or a series of allegories which make sense of your story. Start broad, then work to narrow your definition until you have a concise record that you feel good about.

---

#### Activity 2.5.2b: Purpose Exploration

Brainstorm, make notes, and generate ideas now.




**In 10 words or less, what is the theme or meaning that ties your life together?**




---

#### Element 3: Content (Your Stories)

The third part to telling a persuasive story is the actual content of the story. The story needs to be consistent and coherent while demonstrating your values and purpose.

**Focus on Turning Points**

One of the most effective ways of achieving this is to focus on the turning points of your life. What stories from your past helped to shape you into the person you are today? These times, generally from childhood, demonstrate that you are a human who possibly overcame something significant. The story needs to give a glimpse of the deeper feelings within you and how you were affected. When choosing your turning point story, focus on a time that demonstrates a significant disruption, a reaction, and overcoming.

**The Hero's Journey⁷**

People generally love a hero's tale. The wonder and inspiration encapsulated by venturing into the unknown, overcoming a series of trials, suffering a significant loss, overcoming odds, and returning to face the world born anew are classic and effective. Yet, if it is false, then it is all for nothing. I am not asking you to stay who you have always been. I am telling you to be honest in your storytelling.

Everybody has a hero's story of their own. What you should have done, and should still be doing, is identifying your hero's story. Although we are generally the protagonist of our own story, many people have a hard time picturing themselves as a genuine hero. Authenticity does not mean remaining the same person. It means owning your journey.

Every person reading this is at a different point in their hero's journey. Some overcome great odds at very young ages while others never get the chance to see their journey through. Part of living a fulfilled life means identifying the person you wish to be and striving to be that person, not through sleight of hand or a web of lies, but with personal growth, persistence, and grit.

**Content Guidelines**

- **Demonstrate a balanced life.** While remaining authentic, you (most probably) do not want to describe yourself as a bohemian, but you want to avoid being perceived as a robot as well. You need to display your human nature while preserving your professionalism.

- **Tell stories of triumph.** Positivity and success tend to resonate the way we want them to. Prospective employers likely won't be drawn to someone who builds their identity around failure.

- **Practice humility.** Do not gloat, brag, or be overly self-congratulatory. Overstating your achievements will turn your audience off and make them doubt your credibility. Giving credit to those who were involved in your successes will display humility while painting you as a good team player.

- **Include emotional reality.** Emotion is significantly stronger than reason. Appealing to empathy is a shortcut to building trustworthy relationships. Emotions add depth to the story, making them more engaging, and to your character, making you a better job candidate.

- **Use limited humor.** Using limited humor shows mastery over your faults and can display an appropriate level of emotion and sensitivity. Job hunting, networking, and preparing for interviews are not the time for inappropriate jokes of any sort.

- **Provide context.** Identity stories are typically colorful, evoking the sights and sounds and smells of the setting. Construct a visceral, emotionally relatable story which demonstrates your drive and mission through overcoming some significant obstacle.

#### Activity 2.5.2c: Content Development

List 3-10 evocative stories from your past. These can be stories you have already used for this program (remember, you have a better chance of making a good choice when you are choosing from a field of options):




Quickly jot down emotions, adjectives, and other vital descriptors associated with each story:




Describe the life lesson you learned in every story, using six words or less for each:




How does each of these life lessons tie into the theme of your life? Be explicit:




---

#### Element 4: Audience (Preparation)

The final thing to consider when constructing a persuasive story is your audience. Prepare your story to fit your audience. Otherwise, you may think you are communicating one idea while they hear something completely different.

That said, this is not the most compelling tactic of persuasive storytelling; the preeminent objective is portraying your authentic humanity. The reason you need to consider your audience is that people are empathetic to situations with which they can relate.

**Example:** If you are sharing an experience about writing code with sales associates, the monotony of drafting 10,000 lines of code will likely fall on deaf ears. To better your chances, consider what struggles the salespeople have overcome themselves. For instance, tell your coding story from the angle of overcoming denial and repeated failure to reach eventual triumph. While they may not be able to relate to writing code, they know what it is to overcome the word "no." The story is still about coding, but it is told with respect for the audience and the challenges they face.

Every person, every organization, has a story that comprises their identity. To prepare, you will research each of the interactions you have before you have them. Study your audiences, learn their stories, and estimate where they are in the process of their story. People like to hear about themselves without being told who they are. Do not tell them where they are or who they are, and do not be presumptive. Learn about them so that you can present yourself in a manner that best fits their needs, without fabrication.

**The best stories align you, the people in the room, and the organization at large into a cohesive and logical picture.** Just like your best life aligns your life values and your work values, the best hire and the best job aligns the stories of all who are involved. Upon hearing your story, the audience should come to the natural conclusion that you are the perfect fit. Tell your story in a way that demonstrates how well you fit without explicitly saying it.

---

#### Activity 2.5.2d: Audience Awareness

Record 2-5 times you built a fantastic rapport with someone:




What made those interactions successful?




---

### Exercise 2.5.3: Drafting Your Story

**Purpose:** Write your complete identity story and professional allegory using the SOARED framework.

The acronym I teach for storytelling is SOARED.¹¹ I don't just want you to describe a time you were successful—tell stories of when you truly soared.

**S**ituation – describe the setting, what was happening  
**O**bstacle – what was the problem, the disruption, which had to be overcome  
**A**ction – what action did you take to surmount the obstacle  
**R**esults – what was the result of your action; was the problem solved or not  
**E**valuation – did you do everything you could have; what did you miss or how did you succeed  
**D**iscovery – in hindsight, what have you learned from the event

You can use this for these stories. Use this method when answering questions in interviews. SOARED will ensure that you don't miss any critical details while keeping the answer logical, orderly, and natural.

#### Story Guidelines⁸

According to Stephen Denning's storytelling framework, effective identity stories should demonstrate:

- **Relevance:** Does it reflect the kind of person you are to the necessary audience?
- **Clarity:** Is your role in the story clear? Are your values reflected clearly in the story?
- **Distinctiveness:** Does the story indicate what is unique about you?
- **Consistency:** Is the story consistent with the way you conduct your life now?

---

#### Activity 2.5.3a: Identity Story

**Your First Story: The Identity Story**

This is not an autobiography. It should be about 1 page typed and needs to make sense of your values, work history, future goals, and your life mission. It is the story you tell yourself, the ideal which you try to live by. We will build off of this story to create your resume, elevator pitch, and your general presentation—it does not need to be any of those yet.

Explain your roots, how they made you who you are, and how you have grown into the intentional and capable person that you are today. You may not feel as though you have a cohesive story. Today is your opportunity to create that story. Take your time and revisit this task occasionally. To move forward in the process, you need to have an explicitly written identity today.

**Write your identity story here (approximately 1 page):**










---

#### Activity 2.5.3b: Professional Allegory

**Your Second Story: The Allegory**

This is the full expression of Element 3 (Content). This single allegory should provide a window into your entire life. When done correctly, this story will communicate some combination of your values, your character, and your passion to the listener, without explicitly stating any of them.

Use real stories from your past. Use these guidelines:

**About:**
- A favorite place when you were young and what made it special to you
- How you overcame adversity or an obstacle when you were young
- An incident with someone whom you admired or who influenced you
- The most significant thing that happened to you when you were young

**Check against:**
- **Relevance:** Does it reflect the kind of person you are to the necessary audience?
- **Clarity:** Is your role in the story clear? Are your values reflected clearly in the story?
- **Distinctiveness:** Does the story indicate what is unique about you?
- **Consistency:** Is the story consistent with the way you conduct your life now?

**Write your allegory here (approximately 1 page):**
