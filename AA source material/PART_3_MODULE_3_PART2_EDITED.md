### Exercise 3.3.2: The Art of Conversation and Building Rapport

**Purpose:** Develop effective conversation skills for networking and interviews.

There is nothing in the world quite like an excellent conversation. The kind that leaves you in a euphoric glow, the ones you return to when your mind wanders years later. The best conversations can be had between complete strangers or a couple of 65 years. People from entirely different backgrounds, even people who are at odds with one another, share amazing interactions every day.

Networking is intimately related to conversation. If this fact is daunting for you, remember that most people in your target field are similar to you. There is a fair likelihood that the people you encounter are socially similar to you. Ideally, you are going to share an interest (the field you want to work in) with each contact. Everyone you encounter holds some nugget of truth that can help you on your journey, and every person is perfectly capable and good enough to build the relationships necessary to bridge between the present and the desired future.

The classic advice for conversations and interviews includes eye contact, nodding along with the speaker, summarizing what you hear to ensure clarity, and coming prepared with a list of questions. For the most part, it's poor advice focused on the symptoms rather than the root. **The secret? Be present and pay attention.** Embody the mindsets listed above. Approach them with genuine curiosity and the desire to collaborate. Be aware of their needs, and listen for any clues they might give you. Always listen first.

**First impressions are important.** First impressions are mostly made up of emotional impacts (did you like the person, or not?). Leave your encounters with a positive emotional feeling attached to your name, and they will likely forget the small mistakes you made along the way. Professional flattery is serviceable, and flattery via asking for advice will often get you in the door. However, once you are sitting down with someone, building real rapport takes a bit more than simple flattery.

Of all the great advice out there, I have found that Celeste Headlee covers the most critical aspects with her principles for conversations and interviews.⁶

**Be interested in other people. Everyone has something brilliant to share. Keep your mouth shut, your mind open, and you will never be let down.**

#### Activity 3.3.2a: Ten Principles for Better Conversations⁶

**1. Don't Multitask**

Multi-tasking isn't real. No human can genuinely do two things at once. Many people try to switch quickly back and forth between tasks, which inhibits their ability to perform either task. Focus on one thing at a time.

When you are talking with someone, be present in the conversation. Do not engage with technology, resist the urge to daydream, and keep yourself grounded in the situation at hand. Find your way out if you are done with the conversation. Don't waste the other person's time by disrespecting them.

**With an exception for extreme emergencies, do not look at or pick up your phone.**

**2. Don't Pontificate**

The goal is to collaborate, which means you have to invite dialogue. Don't give speeches that are uninvited. Conversations require multiple participants. If you want to talk to yourself, do it on a blog or in a journal; don't waste other people's time.

Always be willing to learn something new. Every idea that you do put forward could open up your cohort to information that could change your life—be prepared to hear what they have to say. Set your ego aside before every conversation you have. The more open you are, the more open the other person feels in the discussion, the more they will share with you. The goal of networking is to learn from other people and build relationships. Approach every conversation as a student ready to learn.

**Everyone is an expert at something; be approachable enough for people to show you their expertise.**

**3. Use Open-Ended Questions**

Open-ended questions generally start with a "w" (who, what, when, where, how) and lack specifics. You want to know what the other person thinks, so don't give them a place to start their answer. Force them to think about what to say and to craft a genuine response. This process accomplishes two things: it shows them that you value their input while allowing them to open up to you. Let people show you how they think; don't make any assumptions.

**BAD:** "Did you learn about perseverance and teamwork when you led your high school basketball team to the championship in 2005?"

**BETTER:** "What life lessons did you learn from playing basketball in high school?"

In the first example, the question gives the target possible answers. The target could feel like their honest answer isn't as good as the suggestions, or that it is easier to say "yes" than it is to provide honest reflection. Further, it is entirely possible that the most significant lessons learned from that part of the target's life didn't come during the championship run. The second example specifies what type of answer is being sought without providing any potential outs. The question has a specific target while remaining open-ended.

**Every time you ask a question, wait for the other person to answer.** Sometimes people have to think about what to say. Do not jump in with another question or any suggestions. Adding more questions is confusing. Suggesting answers gives the person an excuse not to provide a thorough and genuine response. Both are disrespectful and show the other person that you don't care about what they have to say.

**4. Go With The Flow**

Great ideas will inevitably occur to you while someone else is talking. Either quickly make a short note of them, or let them go entirely.

These ideas can completely derail a conversation. By engaging with your idea, you disengage with the speaker. The speaker may answer your question or bring up something more interesting and relevant while you are distracted inside your head.

**Let ideas come, and let them go.** Think about how irritating it can be when you are telling a story, and someone answers with a seemingly unrelated question. When it is time for you to ask a question, trust that you will either remember what you had to say or that it wasn't meant to be. Engaging with people is of paramount importance. Getting lost in your thoughts is a great way to lose rapport with someone.

**5. If You Don't Know, Say That You Don't Know**

Honesty is an astounding tool when practiced regularly. Better to be honest and open to learning than to bluff and appear unprofessional and untrustworthy. If someone is taking the time to explain something to you, be sure that you understand the premise to comprehend the message best. Just as you should be aware of how others are receiving your words, you must also take care to grasp ideas and stories that are shared with you wholeheartedly.

**Don't lie about your abilities, knowledge, and skills.**

**6. Never Equate Your Experiences With Another Person's**

No matter how similar two instances may seem, there is never an opportunity to volunteer your own story as a comparison. Listen with intent, not for the sake of comparison but for the purpose of learning about the person speaking. By comparing your own experiences, you fail to absorb the detail and nuance of the experience being shared with you while you also disrespect the sharer, making them less comfortable to share more.

If, afterward, you are invited to communicate your own experience, do not compare and contrast the two. Take the time to tell your story as it occurred, not as a comparison to another. You will not further rapport or the relationship by promoting yourself with experiential comparisons. **All experiences are individual.** Build open communication by acknowledging the validity of unique experiences.

**7. Try Not To Repeat Yourself**

Generally speaking, people hear you the first time you say something. Unless they ask you to repeat yourself, don't. It is condescending to assume that they did not understand or to demand an answer for a particular question. Respect people's boundaries and allow people to communicate with you in the way they are most comfortable.

Repetition is monotonous and does not further any arguments. Repeatedly approaching the same point from different angles is a great way to turn off a prospect and destroy any rapport built. If it is indeed a matter of misunderstanding, then work on clarifying communication, but be wary.

**8. Stay Out Of The Weeds**

Dates, numbers, temperature, names of ancillary characters, the exact shade of blue paint—most of the time, people don't care about the details. Conversations have a flow to them. A rhythm of back and forth between the involved parties. Stopping to conjure the exact date of the meeting that led to a huge breakthrough is going to have a significant impact on building rapport—a negative one. The flow of the story that you are telling is far more meaningful than the date itself. **People are easily distracted. Keeping their attention and engaging their mind is the goal.** Breaking flow loses the audience's attention.

If you forget a specific detail, don't sweat it and move on. If the date is of particular importance to your audience, they will ask for it. If it is imperative for your story, be prepared with a written reminder.

**9. Listen**

Listening might be the most valuable skill in the world. It is undoubtedly the most important for our purposes. Listen for the sake of understanding and nothing more. Immerse yourself in the person who is sharing with you. Engage fully in creating rapport by clearing your mind of any distractions and forcing yourself to listen.

The human brain is capable of following about 500 words per minute, while we can only speak at around 275 words per minute. So, roughly half the time, you must consciously engross yourself in the story. No matter how boring or slow the contact might be, hang on every word as if it is the secret to eternal happiness.

Keeping the human brain on topic and away from daydreaming takes mental effort. This effort can be practiced and strengthened by practicing mindfulness (Exercise 1.5.3).

**No one ever listened their way out of a job.**

**10. Be Brief**

### Exercise 3.3.3: Target Information

**Purpose:** Understand what information to gather from networking conversations.

You do not want to dictate every conversation too rigidly, or you will stifle genuine rapport and fail to build meaningful relationships. You do not want to be completely free-form, or your discussions will lack direction and meaning. There isn't an exact checklist of what you need to learn from your contacts while you are networking, but I'll do my best to give you one.

**The main goal is to build and create professional rapport.** Networking for this purpose is not a practice in making friends; it's for developing professional contacts. Although the two are not totally dissimilar. Professionalism is not void of emotional connection, but it must keep a reasonably professional focus.

---

#### Activity 3.3.3a: Information Checklist

| Category | What to Learn |
|----------|---------------|
| **Topic** | Stay on target, but some time can be spent bonding over shared interests—in the light of lifestyle |
| **About Them** | Origin story, what took them into the work, preferred work conditions, thoughts and feelings about the work they do and the place they work, things they wish they knew coming into the industry, location benefits, traits that fuel their success |
| **From Them** | Contact(s) within the org, workplace attitude and flow, do's and don'ts, gatekeeper tendencies and general character (how to get your foot in the door), possible industry contacts (other orgs doing good similar work), characteristics of success in a specific company and in industry |
| **About You** | Share your story—work and personal story, honest about ambitions without asking for a job, exist within your character—don't be something you are not |
| **General** | Always offer help before leaving, keep a keen ear for some way you can help them during the conversation, offer your network, a small amount of your time (define this while hashing out details). If nothing arises, make a general offer: "Is there any way I can help you?" or "You have been a tremendous resource, thank you. Is there some way I can return the favor?" |
| **Time** | Set a time limit and stick to it |

**Not all information is made equal.** You do not know what question or topic will yield the knowledge you seek, so follow the guidelines for conversation. The best conversations may veer off course only to lead to a fruitful relationship. Go with the flow.

**Shadowing:** You are searching for opportunities to get in the door by either meeting more people, shadowing them a day at work, visiting for a casual gathering—anything that leads towards a productive relationship.

---

### Exercise 3.3.4: The Process of Networking

**Purpose:** Implement a systematic approach to building your professional network.

**Networking is something you need to do habitually for the rest of this program. From this point onwards, build your network each and every day.**

---

#### The 5-Step Networking Process

1. Decide what type of company you want to work for
2. Build a list of companies who could be a good fit
3. Research all of the companies on your list
4. Connect with recruiters and HR professionals in those companies
5. Reach out to and build relationships with the people who work or have worked in those companies

---

#### Activity 3.3.4a: Step 1 – Decide What Type of Company

The type of company you want to work for is determined by your compass (Exercise 2.1.3), the direction your inner light pulls you, and the effect you want to have on the world. This is markedly different from the actual job you are doing. The type of company is who you will be doing your job for. The type of company concerns the goals your work helps to achieve.

You can be a graphic designer for a political campaign or for a vacuum salesman. You can teach in a public school, tutor struggling students, implement corporate training, fight for better education standards in an NGO, and even work in the education sector of some government body. Your chosen career can fit a wide array of fields.

If you have not already made this decision, take the time now to review your work values and your life values (Exercise 2.1.2). Consider your priorities; some fields pay better than others for the same work. For instance, a geologist can choose to do research for a university or search for precious resources with a private company. Only you can make this decision, but I encourage you to speak with those who are close to you for ideas.

**What field of work gives you the best chance of feeling productive and living a life full of value?**

List 3-4 ideas here:




**Which field of work is most appealing to you and best fits your needs and preferences?**




---

#### Activity 3.3.4b: Step 2 – Build a List of Companies

A point to remember is that you are not necessarily looking for companies who are actively hiring. It might seem counter-intuitive but will work to your advantage. As I have mentioned, many companies post jobs online to gather information, while others have already made their decision but are required for one reason or another to "go through the motions."

You want to build a list of companies that are in line with your identity story, fit into your value system, and (preferably) hire people with your skillset. If you do not think they hire people like you, keep an open mind. That criterion certainly makes life more comfortable, but it is not a deal-breaker. More on that later.

**Four Types of Companies:**

**Massive companies** (2500+ employees): High competition for openings, wide variety of locations, established practice for hiring, array of established benefits. Can be great or nightmare scenarios—many treat human capital as numbers rather than people.

**Large companies** (500-2500 employees): More similar to massive companies than different. Bureaucracy can be king in these organizations.

**Medium companies** (150-500 employees): Could be relatively new, up and coming, or recently expanding. May be established in their niche and comfortable where they are. Tend to be good companies to work for—more personal than larger companies while retaining benefits and relative job security.

**Small companies** (less than 150 people): Can be the hardest jobs to find but also have the chance to be the most rewarding. If you find a young company on the way up, it could be the opportunity of a lifetime. If you find a stable company around this size, there is a good chance that the company takes care of its people.

**The Magic Number 150:**⁷ One hundred fifty people is roughly the limit for many tribes across the world. It is also about the limit for the number of people you can have any level of relationship with in one area of your life. The materials company Gore-Tex keeps its factories at 150 people. When people start parking on the grass, they split and build another factory. Keep an eye out for companies around this size.

**Build your list with this ratio:** 5 small companies : 3 medium companies : 2 large/massive companies

Start with 10 companies, do your research, continue the process, and repeat. That way, you don't get stuck brainstorming 50 companies one day then get overwhelmed trying to follow through with the rest of the process for all of them at the same time.

#### Where to Find Companies

**People You Know**

The most immediate resource you have is also the oldest one: the people you know. Start with your close friends and family, and ask them if they know of any companies in the field you are interested in.

From there, move on to your acquaintances, or **weak ties**.⁸ The idea of weak ties comes from Johns Hopkins sociologist Mark Granovetter's paper called "The Strength of Weak Ties." The idea here is that people who know who you are, but you don't spend a ton of time with, likely have access to information and contacts which you do not.

Weak ties can be school associates, co-workers from the past, neighbors, and your children's friends' parents.

**Google**

Google companies that share your values. You are bound to find one or two, and maybe more.

**LinkedIn**

LinkedIn is an incredible resource, particularly for this step of the process. You should have a LinkedIn Profile completed with all of your information up to date (from Exercise 3.2.4).

At this time, you should look to connect with as many people that you know as possible. Keep these connections professional. If you attended a college or university, connect with people you know or knew from that time of your life. While those individuals may not have been professionals when you knew them, there is a good chance that they are now. Connections are useful. Start sending requests and LinkedIn will suggest more for you. Request, request, request.

**Do advanced searches:** Enter the job title or field you are seeking in the search bar and search. Use the "connections" filter to find people you know who do that work. First connections are people you are connected with. Make a note of any of these people you are comfortable reaching out to. Second connections are people whom your connections are connected with. Having a mutual connection increases your chances for positive interactions and gives you some credibility.

**Use the advanced search** to filter for specific job titles, location, industry, education, language, and more.

**Company Pages:** These are awesome. Plug a company you have found into the search bar and make your way to their company page. Along the bottom right (web) or bottom of page (mobile), is a list of similar companies. Start with these companies, recording each in your spreadsheet as you go along.

---

#### Activity 3.3.4c: Building Your Company List

Record companies in the "Potential Employers" tab (Tab 2) of your Job Prospects Spreadsheet:
- Field
- Company name
- Company size
- Company location
- LinkedIn page

**My initial company list:**

| # | Company Name | Size Category | Field |
|---|--------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |
| 6 | | | |
| 7 | | | |
| 8 | | | |
| 9 | | | |
| 10 | | | |

---

#### Activity 3.3.4d: Step 3 – Research Companies

Researching the companies on your list allows you to learn more about the places you might end up working. You are looking to establish your preferences among the field, gain understanding and insight, and get an idea of where you might be a good fit.

The process of finding a good job is similar to dating. It needs to work for both parties. You want to be sure that you will enjoy, or at the very least tolerate, the place where you will be spending most of your time. Ideally, you want the company to express and support your values in some practical manner. Doing work that keeps your work values and your life values in line will be the most rewarding work you can find.

Beyond the immediate fit, this research will also help you in the interview process, and later in your job. You are not only studying your future place of work, but you are also studying the competition.

**For your immediate needs, you want to know:**
- The service they provide
- Their origin story
- Their mission statement
- The story they tell (if different from mission statement)

**Research sources:**
- LinkedIn page
- Company website (including the About section)
- Glassdoor reviews
- General Google search

**While reading reviews, keep in mind that companies do engage in the practice of boosting their own reviews and bombing their competitors.**

The edge that I want you to gain from your research is understanding how your story and the company stories work together. The most robust support you can have in your quest to be offered quality jobs is the aligning of both stories. If everything you have done makes you the perfect fit for what they are looking for, you will get an offer. The stronger your argument, the more power you will have when it comes to negotiations.

**The best stories are founded in truth.** To effectively tell honest stories, you must do thorough research.

---

#### Activity 3.3.4e: Step 4 – Connect with Recruiters and HR Professionals

Recruiters and HR professionals are connectors. They know many people and likely got into their line of work because they enjoy working with and connecting people. Think of these people like the hub of a wheel. By connecting with one person, you have gained secondary connections with a vast range of people.

**How to find them:**
- LinkedIn advanced search for people with "recruiter" in their job title
- Visit profiles of companies on your list
- Search through their employees with keywords: recruiter, talent, human resources, HR

**Connection request template:**

> Dear [recruiter's name],
>
> I am very interested in joining [company name] on their journey to [company mission]. I am a [position title] looking for the next step in my mission to [6-10 word summary of life mission]. Are you the recruiter who handles these kinds of positions? If not, will you direct me to the recruiter who does? Could we set up a time to talk about your organization? In the meantime, please accept this invitation to connect.
>
> [Your name]

**Don't say more.** Once you have sent the invitation, wait for them to accept, or even reach out to you.

**If they do not accept:** That is okay. You have left an excellent first impression by being transparent, forward, and goal-oriented.

**If they do accept but you do not hear from them:** That is okay too. You will now show up as an immediate connection to them, and a secondary connection to their entire network. You have also left a good first impression.

**If you do hear back from them:** Follow up with genuine curiosity and network with them with the same strategies and enthusiasm that you would with any other new professional contact. Primarily, you are hoping for advice, insights, and recommendations. Moreover, ask how you can help them. You want to flatter people professionally, and you want to offer your help. Networking is all about building relationships. These are the gatekeepers; being on their good side is priceless.

---

#### Activity 3.3.4f: Step 5 – Build Relationships with People Like You

The most critical aspect of networking is building relationships. Relationships are the essence of the economy. Interviews are like speed dating—an unnatural encounter with limited information with lasting implications. My goal is to equip you with tools that give you the best possible chance at having and creating positive encounters.

**Up to 85% of new hires come from employee references.** By building relationships with employees in your target industry, in your target companies, you are creating the best possible odds.

**Find people like you** the same way you found the gatekeepers: on the company LinkedIn profile, using the advanced search tool. Reach out to people in order of connection. The closer your connection, the more likely they are to respond. For second-degree connections in your target job market, consider reaching out to your mutual connection and asking for an introduction.

**Remember to be persistent.** Reach out a few times, but keep it to two or three attempts. Instead, direct your persistence towards other options and possibilities. Do not set your heart upon any particular connection. Let the connections come that will. Focus on your successes and learn from your failures.

**Never directly ask these people for jobs.** Approach them with curiosity. You are looking for advice and insight. Networking is like a finger trap: with the finger trap, the harder you pull, the tighter it holds you; you must first push inwards to loosen the grip of the trap before you can remove your fingers. With networking, being bullish rarely works. **By starting the conversation with genuine curiosity, focusing on them and their achievements, you are opening them up to build a real relationship.**

**The key is to ask for advice.** By asking for advice, you are insinuating that they have knowledge that you covet—you are complimenting them. Most people enjoy talking about themselves. Ask to meet for coffee, lunch, or to speak on the phone at a time that is convenient for them. **You never want to ask for more than 20 minutes of their time.** A good tip is to be exact—ask for 19 minutes. If you do that, be serious about your deadline. Set an alarm (on vibrate) for 17 minutes and wrap up the conversation when the time comes.

**Past employees** are wonderful sources of information. While a current employee has an incentive to speak positively about their place of work, someone who has moved on does not. A positive review from someone without much incentive to give one is precious. A reasonably negative review is a serious red flag and deserves your attention.

---

### Exercise 3.3.5: Preparation

**Purpose:** Prepare effectively for networking meetings and negotiations.

---

#### Activity 3.3.5a: Meeting Preparation

**5-10 days prior:**
- Research the company and the person
- Come prepared with a few genuine questions that build on what is commonly known about the company
- Ask what brought the individual to the company
- Establish how your story and the company story intersect

**Immediately before:**
- Take written questions
- Pen and paper
- Solid copy resume
- Dress for the job
- Review research & story intersection
- Breathe

**After:**
- Send thank you notes to secretary and individual with a summary of skills and interview or the bond created

---

#### Activity 3.3.5b: Negotiation Preparation

Before officially accepting any job, negotiate your salary and benefits. Negotiation is the most undervalued portion of most job transitions. **There is no downside to negotiating your salary.**

The basic premise of negotiation is that you have a minimum you are willing to accept, and your future employer has a maximum they are ready to give. If your minimum is lower than the employer's maximum, then the two of you should be able to work out a satisfactory arrangement. If there is no common ground, then there is no deal. **Do not take a job that does not meet your needs.**

The common ground—between your minimum and their maximum—is commonly referred to as **the pie**. Both parties want as much of the pie for themselves as possible. The goal for all parties in negotiation is to identify the pie and take as much of it as possible for themselves.

**Preparation**

There are three central figures you need to identify before engaging in any salary negotiation:
1. **Your needs (BATNA)** – Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. Your BATNA is the point at which you genuinely do not care if you get the deal done or not. The salary package at your BATNA does not excite you. It is your absolute minimum. You should have identified your needs in Part 1. Review them. **Never accept less than what you are worth and what you need.**

2. **Your market value** – To discern how valuable you are to potential employers, you must do some market research. Websites like glassdoor.com can help you identify the range and average salary for people holding similar positions in particular locations.

3. **Your benefits valuation** – Understand how valuable benefits packages are to you. Consider your current situation, how long you plan to stay with the company, and the trajectory of your life when weighing the value of benefits. (Dental, health insurance, incentives, commission, bonuses, paid time off, sick leave, unpaid time off, maternity leave, rollover benefits, stock options, potential career paths, internal training, professional development, continued education, job security, salary vs. hourly, overtime, tax incentives, tech budget, and any industry-specific benefits.)

**Practice**

For some, negotiations are natural and fun. For others, they are entirely foreign and nerve-racking. For all, training will improve your chances of walking away with more of the pie. Negotiate meals with family, activities with friends, and prices at bazaars and flea markets.

**Execution**

Never start a negotiation at your BATNA; begin with the most that you can defend. Let's say the range of incomes for your desired position is $85,000 - $110,000 per year according to your market research. Considering your skillset and experience, you can build an argument for $105,000, and your BATNA is $90,000. Your very first ask should be $105,000 or higher.

Do not egregiously overshoot the max that you are worth. You do not want to insult your potential employer. But you should push the limit. **You will only ever get what you negotiate for.** Once you put out a number, you will have a tough time asking for more. Start high and be ready to negotiate backward or to trade dollars for benefits. Value yourself.

**Never accept less than your BATNA.** Trust the research that you have done and trust that you are worth what you know you are worth.

**Post-Negotiation**

While some negotiations can get heated, the ultimate goal is to reach an agreement. Once you have achieved your goals, be happy about it. Appreciate a company that places value in you and reciprocate that value. Deliver what you promised; do not make a fool of the person/people who agree to pay you what you bargained for. Show your gratitude, but understand that talk is cheap.
