### Environment

**Location, Location, Location**

There are two types of location: Macro and Micro.

**Macro** – Where in the world do you want to be? Do you want to stay in your town or city? Or would you rather be somewhere else? Are there specific activities you wish to have access to? Do you need to live in a city? Or do you prefer the quiet life of the country?

**Micro** – What should your work environment be? Do you need to spend time outside? Is it necessary that you work near a park? Or do you prefer to spend your time indoors? What are your preferred working conditions? Micro-environment might be considered the look and feel of the workplace.

Of course, the more flexible you are, the more opportunities you will find. Also, generally speaking, where there are more people, there are more opportunities. Still, it is essential to know your preferences; you might find your dream job in your dream location. There is only one way to find out.

Do this exercise even if you feel you already know where you want to be. First of all, you might surprise yourself. If not, then you have found more evidence to support what you already thought.

### Exercise 1.2.1: Macro Environment Preferences

**Purpose:** Identify and rank your preferred geographic locations for living and working.

#### Activity 1.2.1a: Location Desires & Constraints

1. Do you know where you want to live?

   a) If you do, write that here. If not, write down the characteristics of a place that you might want to live.  
   *(Example: by the ocean, has an active nightlife, quiet, access to nature, etc.)*



   b) What are your location restraints?


   c) Do you need to live in a specific country?


   d) Do you need to stay close to your family?


   e) Do you have medical needs?

#### Activity 1.2.1b: Past Location Analysis

2. Struggling for ideas? Even if you are 100% certain, do the following:

   a) Write down every place you have lived.




   b) List every single thing you disliked about those places.  
   *(What does it have? What does it lack? What type of people are there? What feelings does it give you?)*



   c) List the opposites of each of the location traits you dislike. Also, list any positive traits that come to mind.



   d) Rank the positive location traits using the Ranking Grid (see Resources).



---

#### Activity 1.2.1c: Location Research (Internet)

3. Research. Open your mind to possibilities. Find as many good ideas as possible. Look for places that meet your needs and have as many of your top 5 location traits as possible.

   a) Search the Internet.
   
   - Search for places which excel in each of your desired traits. Make lists.



   - Are there any which excel in multiple?



   - Find 5-10 places which make you excited. Record what excites you about each location.



---

#### Activity 1.2.1d: Location Research (Network)

   b) Ask around. Family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances—you never know what treasure they hold until you ask.
   
   - Write down your ranked list of location traits and ask 10-20 people if they know of anywhere which has those traits. Write down their ideas. ALWAYS thank them for their time and effort.



   - Are there any locations which excel in multiple traits?



   - Research each of the locations which embody multiple of your desired traits.



   - Find 5-10 places which make you excited. Record what excites you about each location.



---

#### Activity 1.2.1e: Top 10 Location Ranking

4. Narrow down your two lists to a single list of 10 possible locations. Rank those ten from most exciting down.




5. **IF YOU HAVE A PARTNER**

   Before you make a list of locations – Before you start researching –

   - Both of you do Activities 1.2.1a & 1.2.1b separately.
   
   - Discuss your preferred location traits. Find any similarities.
   
   - Rank your combined traits using the Ranking Grid. (Combine the top 5 from each partner)
   
   - Then both of you complete Activity 1.2.1c & 1.2.1d
   
   - Do Activity 1.2.1e together. Compare your findings. Discuss honestly. Agree upon ten possible locations. Rank together.


6. Pay the most attention to, make a special note of, your top 3 locations.

### Exercise 1.2.2: Micro Environment Preferences

**Purpose:** Define your ideal workplace environment and conditions.

Now we will focus on the look and feel of the workplace.

For each of the following, consider each productive space you have ever had. You may include classrooms, a desk at home, a library, or a cafe. Any space where you get work done is worth studying.

---

#### Activity 1.2.2a: Workplace History Review

1. Previous Employment

   a) List every job you have had.



   b) List every work condition which had a positive impact upon you, your mood, or your effectiveness.



   c) List every work condition which had a negative impact upon you, your mood, or your effectiveness.



   d) What would the opposite of those negative influences be?



---

#### Activity 1.2.2b: Ideal Workplace Description

2. Consider the above. Describe your ideal workplace.




   a) How does the office look?


   b) What is nearby?


   c) Are there any important features?


   d) What part of the city or town is it best?


   e) Is it near child care?


   f) What else can you think of?


---

### Exercise 1.2.3: People Preferences

**Purpose:** Identify the characteristics of people you work well with and for.

For many, we spend more time with the people we work with than the people we live with. For that reason, aim to have a clear idea of whom you work well with, what types of people can help you to be more productive, and what kinds of people are a negative influence on your work and life.

Simply understanding these things does not guarantee that you will love your next co-workers, but it certainly helps to know what you are looking for.

It is also essential to understand the type of people you like to work for. You work for your boss, and you work for your client, customer, pupil, audience, family, organization, etc. You work for the people who depend on you to do your job.

Some people thrive in competitive environments while others need emotional support. Some people need specific direction, and others need to be left to their expertise. Some people work extraordinarily well in groups, and others prefer solitary labor.

This exercise is designed to help you identify the sorts of people you are productive with and for and the sorts of people you are not.

Refer to your complete list of experiences from Exercise 1.1.1 (Transferable Skills Inventory).

---

#### Activity 1.2.3a: Negative Influence Identification

1. Review each job or experience you have had. Recall and record the traits of the people who hurt your productivity in any way. Maybe you didn't like them, but do not focus on who they are. You need to pinpoint what about them made your work less productive. List the harmful character traits.


2. Write the antonym of each of the traits from number 1.


---

#### Activity 1.2.3b: Positive Influence Identification

3. Review each job or experience you have had. Recall and record the traits of the people who helped your productivity in any way.


4. Recall any time when you were particularly productive. The production can be from your education, the stories you wrote in Exercise 1.1.1, or work experience. Who was directing you? Were you serving anyone (client, etc.)?


5. What traits do the people from question 4 have that support a positive work environment?


---

#### Activity 1.2.3c: Ideal Colleague & Supervisor Profile

6. What types of people do you want to work with?


7. Do you prefer to work in teams, pairs, or alone?


8. What types of people do you want to work for?


9. Who in this world do you want to serve with your work?


---

### Exercise 1.2.4: Compensation Analysis

**Purpose:** Determine your financial needs, benefit requirements, and establish your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement).

How much money do you want to make?  
How much money do you need to make?  
What are your needs?  
How much do you plan to save?  
What bonuses and extras are you seeking from your work?

---

#### Activity 1.2.4a: Salary History

1. Record how much you have made at each of your positions, including any changes in pay at any one position.


---

#### Activity 1.2.4b: Budget Creation

2. Write a complete budget. Use the spreadsheet titled "Budget", or compare your own to the one I have provided. Costs are listed on the left. Fill in how much you spend per month on the right. Below you will find...

   – TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES →  
   – TOTAL ANNUAL EXPENSES →  
   – MINIMUM HOURLY WAGE →

Be diligent about your budget, and live within your means. Unless you are giving the loan, debt is not your friend. It is easy to spend money; it is difficult to save money. Wealth is built by saving and investing wisely.

---

#### Activity 1.2.4c: Benefits Assessment

3. What benefits do you need?



---

#### Activity 1.2.4d: Compensation Structure Evaluation

   **Hourly** (pay for time worked)


   **Contracting** (pay agreed upon per project, typical for freelancers)


   **Commission** (% of sale per sale)


   **Combination of above, or Other** (specify)

### Module 1.2 Footnotes

7. This approach to work-life integration draws from Paula Caligiuri's philosophy in *Get a Life, Not a Job: Do What You Love and Let Your Talents Work for You.* Upper Saddle River, NJ: FT Press, 2010. Caligiuri emphasizes that your work should support your life goals, not the other way around.
