# Part 2: Trunk
## Connecting Your Past to Your Future

---

## Overview

Now that you have taken stock of your literal makeup and background, it is time to take a higher level view of who you are, how you are doing, and where your life is going. If you are unsure about the path ahead, that is okay. If you are confident you know where your path leads, that is okay too. Go through each exercise with an open mind. If you are searching for answers, this process will guide you through finding them. If you are decided and confident, this will provide reassurance, perspective, and ensure that you did your due diligence. Just as with the roots, understanding where you are can only help you reach greater heights.

The trunk of our tree represents the present. This is where your past meets your future. In many respects, the present is the only thing that genuinely exists. Everything else is an interpretation. Your mission is to interpret your situation to your benefit and steer towards your best possible future.

There is no possible way to know every effect of each and every choice we make. Therefore, it is impossible to make the best decision in every instance. So, we gather as much information as is needed, and then we make a choice. Bias to action.¹

Approach this part with an open mind. A lot of this will be brainstorming. When brainstorming, defer to quantity over quality. We, as people, have all sorts of social filters which hinder most people from thinking creatively. Your job is to ignore anything that tells you something is a bad idea and write it down anyway.

There will be a time and a place for evaluation, but first, you need to generate as many ideas as possible. While the most outlandish ideas don't always seem useful, they open the door for creativity and can often lead to innovation. Remember, many of the most incredible discoveries were made by accident—open yourself up to those accidents.

**Important:** You are going to need a small group of people who know you but do not think they know what you need to do for your next step in life. 2-3 other people works best, but even one will help tremendously.

### Introduction

Every plant grows towards the light. The light is nourishing for trees.

You, too, must reach towards your light. Once you identify what your light is, it will guide you through your decision-making process. Anytime you have a decision to make, your light will tell you which way to go—grow towards the light. So, what is your light? What is nourishing for you?

---

### Exercise 2.1.2: Values Exploration

**Purpose:** Articulate your work values and life values to identify your guiding compass.

It is time to identify your light and begin to understand the compass that will guide you into the future.

There are two main values to consider: your **work values** and your **life values**. Values are not a description of what you want or what you are seeking. This is philosophical. Reflect on the deeper meaning. There are no wrong answers, except for blank answers.

---

#### Activity 2.1.2a: Work Values

**Work**

1. What does work mean to you?


2. Why do you work?


3. Why do other people work?


4. What is the purpose of people working?


5. Other than money, what is gained from work?


6. Are honor, growth, or fulfillment essential to work? Explain.


7. What work would you do if all your needs were guaranteed?



---

#### Activity 2.1.2b: Life Values

**Life**

1. Is there a meaning of life? Give details.


2. What is the meaning of your life?


3. Why do we exist?


4. What is good?


5. What is evil?


6. What is happiness?


7. Is there a higher being?


8. Why do we experience pain and suffering?


9. Is there some deeper meaning, mission, or purpose to life?


10. What injustices are there in the world?


---

### Exercise 2.1.3: Values Alignment

**Purpose:** Find the intersection of your work and life values—your compass.

The most fulfilling lives grow from the place where life views and work views overlap.¹,² In other words, if your work values complement your life values, your life will have more value.

---

#### Activity 2.1.3a: Alignment Analysis

1. Where do your two value systems support each other?


2. Where do they disagree?


3. Is one more important to you than the other? Which one? Why?


4. In your own words, explain how your work values and your life values work together.




---

#### Activity 2.1.3b: Value Compass Definition

You spend a tremendous amount of your life working. The more closely your work supports your values, the more rewarding your life will be. **The overlap between your work values and your life values is where your light shines the brightest.** The closer your work—the way you spend your productive time—complements your values, the more rewarding your life will be.

If you are unclear on what you value, talk to people who know you well, or research your idols' values and compare your values to their values. This alignment is the light you are using to guide the next steps in your life—be diligent.

If you find yourself stuck, practice free writing several potential answers to the questions. Then, choose which solution is best for you or combine them to create another. This doesn't need to be a world-altering philosophy, but you do need to clarify your values.

**My Value Compass:**

*(Write a brief statement that captures the overlap between your work values and life values—this is your guiding light for career decisions)*
