### Introduction: Breaking Into the Hidden Job Market

Almost everything in life is, at its core, based on relationships. Notably, and most importantly for our cause, finding and securing a job. Every step of this program, of any job program, is essentially an exercise in communicating who you are to other people and communicating to them that you are the best fit for a given position. Success in any particular job is largely based upon relationships: relationships with your boss, your coworkers, your clients, other branches of your organization, and so on.

**Relationships hold the keys to the hidden job market.** Even if you already have a pending interview, this is the absolute best way to prepare for that interview, and it will give you a unique edge over your competition. In the coming days and weeks, you will be acting upon everything you learn today. You are more than welcome to start working upon what you learn as soon as possible, but make sure you read through and understand this entire module first.

Up to now, you have expressed and recorded your experience, established your professional identity, and crafted the image that you project into the world. From this point onward, use that projection to reach out into the world and land your next job. When the time comes, reach out to, and have conversations with, professionals in your target industry.

With my help, you will identify people who currently or previously do the job that you want to be doing and have genuine conversations with them.

---

### Why This Method Works

There are several reasons that networking in this particular way works so incredibly well:

**First,** an interview is a conversation. In the most successful interviews, the candidate and the employer build a sense of rapport. Interviewer and interviewee come to find that they have the same goals, can fill each other's needs, and have a good chance of building a productive and pleasant relationship.

**Second,** the employers' preferred method of finding quality hires—the method that yields the most consistent results—is not sifting through resumes, but rather hiring someone that they know.¹ For better or worse, the classic phrase "it is not what you know, but whom you know" is very real and very effective. Rather than being a martyr to the flawed cause of using the traditional method, do your future employer a favor and do the extra networking.

**Third,** by embracing the proper mindset (curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration),³ you will learn how real people doing your dream job found their way to where they are.

**Fourth,** you can use psychology to your advantage. When you approach people asking for a job, they automatically start screening you through that filter and assessing whether or not they can afford to bring you on as an employee. If they don't already think they have room for you, they will almost certainly shut you down from the start. Further, they are less likely to send you in a helpful direction. **By starting the conversation with genuine curiosity, focusing on them and their achievements, you are opening them up to build a real relationship.** Relationships lead to opportunities.

**Fifth,** you are doing vital research while you are networking. The best way to know if a job is a good fit for you is to do the job. If you are able to, you can find internship or shadowing opportunities through direct contacts. The next best way to know is to speak to people who do that job. Networking conversations and actual time spent at the place of work provide the opportunity to get inside information about each of the companies and places of work in your field, directly from the source. You will uncover a treasure of knowledge that is otherwise unavailable to you. You will learn about alternative paths into your desired work.

**This method of networking is tried and true by the best job programs in the world. Why? Because it works.** You may have to speak to 50+ people before finding the perfect fit. Stick to it, and it is guaranteed to work. Build relationships with the people in your industry to find otherwise hidden opportunities.

There is little better preparation for an interview than speaking directly with the people who do the work you are looking to do. Not only are you gaining valuable knowledge about the actual work, but you are building relationships inside your industry and practicing for your interview. In every conversation you have, during your networking and the actual interview process, you will be using the same skills. The more practice you get, the more prepared you will be.

### Exercise 3.3.1: Mindset in Practice

**Purpose:** Internalize the five designer mindsets for effective networking.

Everything up to this point and everything you do moving forward depends on your mindset. People talk a lot about the power of positivity and the idea of persistence. I, like many others, have looked into these ideas and done my part to live by them. Positivity provides decent direction, but it lacks depth as a rule to live by.

While looking for something more practical, I came upon the "designer mindset" laid out by Bill Burnett in his book *Designing Your Life*.³ I have mentioned these ideals in brief throughout the course. Now I'll elaborate the five mindsets, the logic behind them, and how to implement each one effectively.

---

#### What It Isn't

Before diving into the meat of these mindsets, I would like to explain what they are not. I do not want you to fabricate stories about yourself and your capabilities. The line between conducting proper research to prepare for your audience and falsely presenting yourself as their savior can be thin.

Authenticity is a tricky subject. The most potent stories resonate with the audience, often engaging in emotional realities shared by the protagonist and the audience. The tale of reinventing yourself is excellent, but you have to practice what you preach. **Your story, your networking, must be genuine.**

People generally love a hero's tale.⁴ The wonder and inspiration encapsulated by venturing into the unknown, overcoming a series of trials, suffering a significant loss, overcoming odds, and returning to face the world born anew are classic and effective. Yet, if it is false, then it is all for nothing. I am not asking you to stay who you have always been. I am telling you to be honest in your storytelling.

Everybody has a hero's story of their own. What you should have done, and should still be doing, is identifying your hero's story. Although we are generally the protagonist of our own story, many people have a hard time picturing themselves as a genuine hero. **Authenticity does not mean remaining the same person. It means owning your journey.**

Every person reading this is at a different point in their hero's journey. Some overcome great odds at very young ages while others never get the chance to see their journey through. Part of living a fulfilled life means identifying the person you wish to be and striving to be that person, not through sleight of hand or a web of lies, but with personal growth, persistence, and grit.⁵ It is entirely possible to swindle your dreams into reality, but what I want for you is a reality built with solid foundations. I am not here to teach you how to lie or be a charlatan. My dream is to help you identify and harness your potential and then achieve it.

Your journey will last until your dying breath. Your life is a story that you get to create. There are surely outside forces that affect you—carefully choose how to react to them. Be an active player rather than a spectator, and you increase the odds of achieving the life of your dreams.

#### Activity 3.3.1a: Awareness

**Awareness**

Everything discussed so far involves some level of awareness. Be aware of yourself, others, and your environment. For this particular part of your journey, be aware that finding and landing your dream job is a process.

Being aware of your daily environment requires active involvement. Awareness is the difference between being a participant and a player. To affect outcomes and push the needle in your favor, start by being aware. To start, try being as present in each moment as possible. Use your senses to observe reality as it is presented to you, and don't assume anything. Be aware of what you see, smell, hear, taste, and feel.

By assuming nothing and approaching everything as a detached observer, you can become aware of details you and others otherwise overlook. Awareness goes beyond what is immediately obvious and peers into the unknown and the hidden. The sleight of hand used to perform magic tricks is an excellent example of manipulating awareness and pushing the limits of an audience's attention. You have to search somewhere you have never looked to see something you have never seen.

Be open to the concept that everyone is operating according to their own code of ethics, their own story, and their own motives. Keep in mind that **everyone is their own hero**. When you are in a meeting with someone, listen for their values and their needs. By being aware of other people's needs, in the context of their personal and professional narrative, it is easier to understand your contacts and build genuine rapport.

**Always listen for the purpose of understanding, not for the sake of answering.** If you have an idea or comment while someone else is talking, let that idea go, let it pass. Holding onto your idea keeps you from engaging with what the person is saying. They may answer your question before you ask, but you can only know if you are listening and aware. (You should be prepared for every meeting with a pen and paper. Take quick notes; do not write full ideas. Sorting through an entire concept steals your attention.)

**Self-awareness** can be a challenging prospect for many. Aim to be aware of your flaws, your strengths, and your presence. Gain self-awareness by interviewing yourself, asking people close to you the same questions, and comparing and contrasting the answers, sifting through biases in search of the truth. If you are wanting for ideas, read your horoscope or take a free personality quiz. Use the results as a springboard; no test can flawlessly describe who you are. Think very carefully about what is accurate and what is inaccurate, the pieces of your personality that are missing, and any feelings or thoughts you might have about the entire topic.

Others can provide a perspective that you might not consider. When you ask others about your tendencies, be aware of the fact that you might not like what you hear. Prepare yourself to be open and receptive to their criticism. Ask your helper to balance positive feedback with criticism, and do not let them tear into you incessantly. You will not learn anything if you are emotionally inflamed; there is no reason to subject yourself to more criticism than you can handle with a level head. Criticize yourself with the goal of self-improvement. More can be gained from a calm and inquisitive mind than from a state of paranoia or judgment.

Finally, be aware of the process, whatever your process might be. In seeking your dream job, that means being aware that this is difficult, and no, you should not give up. Take time to write down everything that brought you to this point and all the possibilities in front of you. Ask if you are taking steps towards your goal each day. Write down all your questions, all your worries, all your hopes, and all your dreams. Observe actions from the perspective of goals and work to understand how the past flows into the future.

**Do your best not to mistake the trees for the forest.** It is easy to get bogged down in the individual steps on your journey. Taking time to lift your head and see where you are along your path will help to keep you motivated while ensuring that you are, in fact, still going the right direction. Do your best to make sure that every step you take follows your compass. Creating and living a coherent story takes intention and awareness.

#### Activity 3.3.1b: Curiosity

**Curiosity**

Curiosity is very similar to existing in the present moment. Meaning that when you are focused on the present—not on what will happen next, not on your past, and not on external drama—you are likely to be more engaged and therefore more curious. Recall from Exercise 1.3.2 (Flow State Mapping) that engagement is our measure for flow, which is when people are at their best and most productive.

**To be genuinely curious, you must be genuinely present.** It is good and proper to prepare a list of questions for an interview, but if you are not present in the interview you cannot ask excellent and relevant questions, you cannot build rapport, and you cannot build a fortuitous relationship.

Curiosity is a trait often exemplified by children. It is the desire to learn, to discover, and to explore. Curiosity breeds innovation, which every growing company is seeking in some fashion. Being curious in your life means being fully engaged with what is happening when it is happening. Curiosity is thirst, and discovery is water.

Ideally, this will not be a chore for you. Aligning your work values and your life values should provide you with some motivation to do the work you are seeking. If you are seeking employment that will fulfill you, you should want to care about every aspect of that work. You are looking for a job, which means that you have questions that need to be answered. The most meaningful answers you can find are to questions that you ask for yourself. **You have to want to learn.** I can lead a horse to water, but I cannot force it to drink. I can show you the door, but I cannot force you to walk through the door. Curiosity is the drive and the will to drink the water, to walk through the door.

Curiosity is awareness. Many opportunities in life go unnoticed. How many times have you lost your keys or your glasses only to find them right under your nose? Chances are, you were distracted by something external or by the stress of the situation itself. By letting the pressure of the situation consume your attention, you fail to notice what you are looking for when it is presented. Curiosity embraces the innocence of the situation and absorbs reality as it is given rather than as we seek it.

**Curiosity means listening for an answer when you ask a question.** The right question can lead to the most rewarding opportunities, but only if you genuinely listen to the response. Going through the motions is not good enough here. You must be willing to learn. You must be thirsty for information. Being curious means admitting your shortcomings and asking for help. It comes from a place of humility. A curious mind is keenly aware that it does not know the answers it seeks.

A curious mind must truly process and chew on new information. Throughout life, we build a system of algorithms in our minds to help us process information. Most of those algorithms are formed in our childhood, or at least while our brain is still developing. For tens of thousands of years, that was more than enough. Today, we exist in a world with more information exposure than ever before. By no fault of any individual, our natural inclinations simply are not good enough. To be open to new information, you have to make an effort to force the door open. You have to override your programming, choose the hard road, and manually sift through new information. Without making an effort to do so, you might discard the gold you are looking for without ever knowing you had it.

**For you, curiosity means seeking people with genuine interest.** Seek and find stories that will help you on your path. Do not go through the motions when networking. They have answers, advice, history, and connections, which can all help you. One—likely more—of the interactions you have will open doors for you.

Emotion is more deeply tied to memory than thoughts are. The most impactful impressions are emotional. We remember people we hate far longer than we remember why we hate them. Words cannot quite capture the meaning of love. **Leave someone with a positive emotional memory attached to your name, and that emotion will influence and eventually dominate the memory.**

By asking for advice and following through with curiosity, you make it easier to form a relationship with the person you are interviewing. Attempt to engage them on their history and their accomplishments, asking them what they did and how they did it.

Come prepared with a set of topics—you could even write out some questions explicitly—but be sure to ask questions about any new information that comes up. Being prepared is essential, but follow the natural flow of the conversation. Use prepared prompts to keep the conversation alive if need be. Do not cut off a live topic unless you are running out of time.

#### Activity 3.3.1c: Bias to Action

**Bias to Action**

Always lean towards taking action. When the options are failure, success, and doing nothing, always choose action. There is no better teacher than failure. **The only wrong answer is inaction.** Be biased toward taking action.

You make thousands of decisions every day. Every decision ends in some action or inaction. Every action or inaction is a step. Life is a journey of a thousand miles. Your values give you a compass to navigate the journey. Pay attention to where each step takes you and keep taking steps.

Think of each decision like an equation:

```
Current Situation = C
Decision = D
Future Situation = F
Reality = R

(C × D) + R = F
```

Good scientific hypotheses utilize constants and a single variable in order to identify and measure reliable results.

To get the best understanding of your current situation, balance objective logic with any feelings or inclinations you might have. While logic dominates the current worldview, science is showing that the body has several layers of processing and storing information. Many of the most reliable tools we have lie outside of the frontal cortex ("go with your heart" and "trust your gut" are more than just idioms).

Reality here refers to entropy and the general rule of chaos in the universe. Reality is anything but predictable—always expect the best and prepare for the worst. Reality is an uncontrollable variable.

Which leaves decisions—the closest thing to control and influence over this equation that anyone has. Even when accounting for the interference of reality, choices play a huge role because this equation runs hundreds or thousands of times a day. Making coherent decisions, following your value compass, living with a code, a mission, or a purpose provides the consistency needed for your bias to action to have a significant impact on future situations and realities.

Running the equation with two variables creates chaos. Consistent, intentional decision making ushers that chaos in a direction. **The more active you are in your decision making, the more control you have in this process.** You can never have complete control, but relentless action will yield results.

Most of the time, people do not recognize the fruits of their labor. The amount of time it takes to notice the effects of our decisions is just long enough that most people forget the decision-making process. This disconnect creates three problems: it is easy to give up before we see results, it is difficult to learn from our decisions, and we rarely give ourselves proper credit. Being biased to action solves all three. Understand your compass, and always take action. Trust that being intentional with the "D" in your equation gives you better odds than non-action.

**The simple truth is that there is no way to know the future.** However, you can do everything in your power to push future realities towards your favor. The more action you take, the harder you work, the more influence you have over your future. Be biased to action.

#### Activity 3.3.1d: Reframing

**Reframing**

Reframing is possibly the most powerful mindset in the bunch. Reframing means observing a situation, finding the most useful perspective possible, and using that perspective to your advantage. Failure is a chance to learn. Being broken means rebuilding stronger. Devastation clears the path for new growth. Practicing reframing can be impersonal, indifferent, and even detached. Leave behind emotional involvement to see the silver lining; **turn every obstacle into an opportunity.**

Through reframing, it is possible to control the current situation as much as possible. Take, for instance, the reality of addiction. An addict in recovery may have massive gaps in their employment history and could be considered unreliable. Fighting addiction means practicing rigorous authenticity, surrendering to the outcome, and doing uncomfortable work—which are all highly prized soft skills that have the power to drive entire companies to success. Reframe a lack of work experience to a complete commitment to honest hard work.

**Every path worth walking encounters rejection.** "No" is a crushing word and reality for many. For others, it is rife with possibility and opportunity, a chance to learn, a chance to grow, a necessary step on the road to success. View rejection with enthusiasm. Turn your most significant obstacle into your greatest strength. Rejection in the job market is an opportunity to learn. Rather than taking it personally, ask for guidance and referrals. While you might not be the right fit for that position, the person who just shut one door could open up the next door for you. While there are no guarantees, overcoming negative momentum is worth reframing the situation in and of itself.

Many great minds have left us with excellent quotes about overcoming failure. What is most important is that you learn from your failures. Take each step as an opportunity to adjust your worldview according to the decisions you made and how they affected your situation. Reframing means actively altering your perspective. Do not blindly make decisions without regard for how and why they do or do not work.

**Reframing is the art of marketing and sales.** While these might not be your expertise, they encapsulate the job search reasonably well. Present your skills in the most palatable design possible to close the deal with one lucky employer. The more compelling your marketing, the stronger your sales will be. Job seekers often overlook their most valuable traits. Every person has a heroic story, but most people don't see how they are a hero. Every job seeker is the perfect fit somewhere. Some fits are more challenging to find.

Practice reframing as often as you possibly can. Change problems into opportunities. Spend the extra energy to change how you view the world as often as possible. Just like training the body, the more practice you have reframing problems, the easier it will get. As reframing gets easier, you will be able to change your perspective on more substantial issues with more impact. Energy invested reframing now will pay off tenfold when your path is easier to navigate and rejection becomes motivation. Luckily for you, if you have been following your schedule, you have been practicing reframing failure since Exercise 2.2.3.

**Reframing is the soul of innovation, creativity, and flexibility.**

#### Activity 3.3.1e: Radical Collaboration

**Radical Collaboration**

The last piece of mindset advice is to embrace radical collaboration. In other words, **talk to people**. Remember that an interview is a two-way conversation; you must collaborate with potential employers, and networking leads to the benefit of everyone involved. The more genuine rapport you build, the more you will get out of your interactions with professionals and peers. The result of radical collaboration is greater than the sum of the individual parts.

Further, for many of the activities in this program, you are asked to talk to peers. Group brainstorming is extremely useful when used correctly. Meaning, it is not the sort of activity that will be successful with half effort. It must be a radical effort.

The goal of brainstorming sessions is to generate new ideas. New ideas flourish in open and accepting environments. Creating open and inviting environments means going past social norms, setting clear boundaries and guidelines for your groups, and taking a leap of faith. There is no guarantee that the people you ask to help you will be the best for the job, but after careful consideration on your part, there is only one way to find out. Approaching any situation with the notion that it will not work before it has even begun is a sure-fire path to an unsuccessful venture. Foster open-mindedness, for it is precious and fleeting.

**In general, always ask for help.** While some see asking for help as a weakness, it is, in fact, a great show of strength. Be aware of what you do not know and seek the answers you need. This integrity builds trust between people and lays solid foundations for fruitful relationships. Generally speaking, people enjoy sharing what they know. That does not mean that everyone will tell you everything they know.

The basis of economic activity is social interaction. Finding a job means finding people to collaborate with. Approach the process of networking and collaboration with excitement and vigor. Find the people you want to grow with by asking genuine questions aimed at solving problems through radical collaboration.
