# Part 1: Roots
## Understanding Your Foundation

---

## Overview

The first part of the tree is the roots. The roots tell us where we came from, where we have been, and what makes us up. Understanding your roots will help them to grow, furthering the stability of your tree, allowing you to reach ever greater heights. Without our roots, we have nothing to hold us up while we reach for the sky.

Roots are hard. Factual and literal, they are a part of history. Now is not the time for conjecture, imagination, or possibilities; those will come in later parts. No two root systems look the same, different people have different needs, skills, and preferences, but the basic components are the same.

With this and every activity, be honest with yourself. Honesty is always the answer. Nobody wins when you lie. Do not lie; do not exaggerate. Give yourself credit for the things you have done. Acknowledge even the smallest accomplishments.

Life designer Bill Burnett separates our life into four categories: love, health, work, and play.¹ These will be our four primary roots.

**Work** is anything related to the creation of value. Work is any economic activity, regardless of your compensation for that activity. Any activities you engage in with the intent of attaining some goal is work. Doing chores, volunteering, earning degrees, and sales are all to be considered work.

**Play** is nearly the opposite. Play is any activity you engage in for the joy of doing it. If you are competing or trying to accomplish something, then it is not play. Play is what most young children do, without a worry in the world, motivated only by the joy that will come. Of the four parts of life, most adults are worst at play.

**Love** is mostly for you to define. I cannot, and will not, advise you on matters of love. If you so choose, there are plenty of other resources on the topic. None-the-less, it is vital for every person and should be considered when planning your future.

Traditionally, **health** is broken into three categories: physical, mental, and spiritual. To reach the greatest heights, care for all three of these areas. I suggest you consider and look after your physical and spiritual health on your own. There are many resources available in the world to answer any questions you have about physical and spiritual help. Everyone has different physical and spiritual needs, so the exercises here focus on mental health. The importance of health cannot be understated.

Understanding all four of these parts of your life will help clarify the path in front of you, not to mention how useful it will be to have all of this information in one place. Save your interpretations for the next part.

You can only ever be exactly where you are, so let's figure out where you're rooted...

## Module 1.1: Work Factors 1

### Module Overview

**Focus:** Skills, Talents & Knowledge  
**Purpose:** Create a comprehensive inventory of your capabilities across three categories: transferable skills, self-management skills, and knowledges  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Key Tools:** Ranking Grid, SOARED Framework, 16Personalities assessment  
**Outputs:**
- Top 10 ranked transferable skills with mastery ratings
- Top 10 ranked self-management (soft) skills
- Complete knowledge inventory with mastery ratings

---

### Skills and Talents

Skills are the most basic unit of performance. Most people think their skills are limited to specific work situations. The goal of this exercise is for you to take full stock of all of your skills, take note of the ones you enjoy the most, and to present them professionally.

According to researcher Sydney Fine, skills can be broken down into three categories: Knowledges, Self-management, and Transferable Skills.²

**Knowledges** are the topics you know, generally nouns.  
*Example: Spanish, chemical engineering, graphic design*

**Self-management skills** describe the way you do your work, generally adjectives/adverbs.  
*Example: Relentless, innovative, meticulous*

**Transferable skills** are the things you can do, generally verbs.  
*Example: Teach, paint, repair, negotiate*

Knowledge is knowing a second language. Self-Management is how often and diligently you practice. Transferable skill is using your second language to some benefit.

All of these are important. First, we want active verbs describing work you can do.

### Exercise 1.1.2: Self-Management Skills Assessment

**Purpose:** Identify your self-management skills (soft skills) using personality assessment and self-reflection.

These are often referred to as Soft Skills. You can find lists of common soft skills that random internet people claim will get you any job. Describing ourselves can be difficult. Doing so originally and authentically can be even more challenging.

---

#### Self-Identification Basics

The Enneagram, Myers-Briggs, the Big 5, and the Self-Directed Search are the most commonly used personality tests. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and they are more alike than they are different.

We will be using an adaptation of Myers-Briggs⁴ as a tool to help us learn about ourselves. It will help you frame your personality in a way which is easier to understand and give you a starting place for finding creative ways to describe yourself. I do not put my full faith into any skills test for many reasons, so remember, this is only a tool.

No personality test is perfect. We will use an adaptation of the Myers-Briggs to give you a starting point for your Self-Inventory.

---

#### Activity 1.1.2a: Personality Type Discovery

The questionnaire will assign you a four-letter code upon completion. Each letter represents your bias on a set of four scales:

- **Extroversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)**
- **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)**
- **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)**
- **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)**

Few people fit their type perfectly. Do not let the results define you. Instead, consider the truths and make a note of the differences.

The purpose of this exercise is to illuminate your character traits and to open your mind to possibilities.

While taking the test, it is essential to answer the questions honestly, as they apply to you. There are no wrong answers. Although some of your responses may make you slightly uncomfortable, it is crucial to be as honest as you are able. The more accurate you are, the more this tool can help you.

**Take the free assessment at:** www.16personalities.com⁵

We need your four-letter code. Write it here: ___________

*(The website where you take the test is a useful resource. Feel free to learn about your type from them, but it is not necessary for this course. I provide you with everything you need to know.)*

#### Activity 1.1.2b: Dichotomy Self-Rating

To be more confident, read through each of these relative dichotomies and mark yourself on each scale below:

**Extraverts** are more likely to be energized by company, enjoy being the center of attention, keep a fast pace, and talk more than they listen.

**Introverts** are more likely to be energized by alone time, be more private, keep their thoughts to themselves, and listen before speaking.

________________________,_________________________  
E                                                  I

**Sensors** tend to be concerned with certainty and what is realistic. They tend to be more literal and are oriented towards the present situation.

**Intuitives** tend to be concerned with innovation and what is possible. They tend to be more figurative and are oriented towards the future.

________________________,_________________________  
S                                                  N

**Thinkers** are likely to be most concerned with logic, applying impersonal analysis to opportunities and decisions. They can be seen as detached or heartless.

**Feelers** are likely to be most concerned with harmony, empathizing with involved parties with tact when making decisions. May be seen as overemotional, valuing all feelings equally.

________________________,_________________________  
T                                                  F

**Judgers** tend to derive the most satisfaction with the completion of a task and manage their time as a finite resource.

**Perceivers** prefer to keep their options open and thrive when adapting to new situations. They often view time and deadlines as elastic.

________________________,_________________________  
J                                                  P

**See Resource: Personality Info for more information about each type:**
- Strengths & weaknesses
- Common character traits
- Strategies, descriptive words, & more

Remember, no test can tell you who you are, but these tools can help you describe your talents and identify your weaknesses.

### Exercise 1.1.3: Knowledge Audit

**Purpose:** Document all your areas of knowledge and expertise with mastery ratings.

Now dive into what you know. The subject matter, the processes, your interests, everything. It is imperative to include everything you know here (or at least as much as possible).

**Knowledges** are the things you know, generally nouns.  
*Example: Spanish, chemical engineering, graphic design*

From work. From your education.  
From your hobbies. From your interests.  
From any of your groups or clubs.  
If it comes to mind, write it down.

You want to start broad. Take stock of everything first.
