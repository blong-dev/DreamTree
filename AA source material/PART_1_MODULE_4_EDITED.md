### Introduction

The focus of this module is love. I think all people have a sense of what love is. You might be more comfortable considering the things and people you care about.

Love can be a tricky topic to talk about. Love manifests in each person's life in a different way. You might have intensely positive, intensely negative, or completely neutral experiences in each of the categories below. The purpose of this activity is not to dictate right from wrong, but to reflect and understand.

Many programs focus on the idea of passion. Passion is simply one of the many paths into flow. Passion is also pretty ambiguous; only about 1 in 4 people know their passion. For our purposes, we will focus on what we love and care about as a window into what might bring us the most fulfillment in the future.

**There are no wrong answers here—these questions are for you and you only.** While you will be asked questions that relate to this topic, my staff and I will not have a copy of your answers; share what you are comfortable sharing.

**Answer every question.** The process works if you work it. This section is no less important than any other section. In fact, this might be one of the most important modules in the program. Seriously reflect on each of these, and record vivid details. Consider telling your stories using the SOARED framework (see Exercise 1.1.1c) so that you don't miss any important details.

Don't leave anything out. Some parts of your life might seem obvious or redundant—record them anyway. You cannot possibly be over-prepared. Do the work.
