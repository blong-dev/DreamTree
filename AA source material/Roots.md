# Part 1: Roots
## Understanding Your Foundation

---

## Overview

The first part of the tree is the roots. The roots tell us where we came from, where we have been, and what makes us up. Understanding your roots will help them to grow, furthering the stability of your tree, allowing you to reach ever greater heights. Without our roots, we have nothing to hold us up while we reach for the sky.

Roots are hard. Factual and literal, they are a part of history. Now is not the time for conjecture, imagination, or possibilities; those will come in later parts. No two root systems look the same, different people have different needs, skills, and preferences, but the basic components are the same.

With this and every activity, be honest with yourself. Honesty is always the answer. Nobody wins when you lie. Do not lie; do not exaggerate. Give yourself credit for the things you have done. Acknowledge even the smallest accomplishments.

Life designer Bill Burnett separates our life into four categories: love, health, work, and play.¹ These will be our four primary roots.

**Work** is anything related to the creation of value. Work is any economic activity, regardless of your compensation for that activity. Any activities you engage in with the intent of attaining some goal is work. Doing chores, volunteering, earning degrees, and sales are all to be considered work.

**Play** is nearly the opposite. Play is any activity you engage in for the joy of doing it. If you are competing or trying to accomplish something, then it is not play. Play is what most young children do, without a worry in the world, motivated only by the joy that will come. Of the four parts of life, most adults are worst at play.

**Love** is mostly for you to define. I cannot, and will not, advise you on matters of love. If you so choose, there are plenty of other resources on the topic. None-the-less, it is vital for every person and should be considered when planning your future.

Traditionally, **health** is broken into three categories: physical, mental, and spiritual. To reach the greatest heights, care for all three of these areas. I suggest you consider and look after your physical and spiritual health on your own. There are many resources available in the world to answer any questions you have about physical and spiritual help. Everyone has different physical and spiritual needs, so the exercises here focus on mental health. The importance of health cannot be understated.

Understanding all four of these parts of your life will help clarify the path in front of you, not to mention how useful it will be to have all of this information in one place. Save your interpretations for the next part.

You can only ever be exactly where you are, so let's figure out where you're rooted...

## Module 1.1: Work Factors 1

### Module Overview

**Focus:** Skills, Talents & Knowledge  
**Purpose:** Create a comprehensive inventory of your capabilities across three categories: transferable skills, self-management skills, and knowledges  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Key Tools:** Ranking Grid, SOARED Framework, 16Personalities assessment  
**Outputs:**
- Top 10 ranked transferable skills with mastery ratings
- Top 10 ranked self-management (soft) skills
- Complete knowledge inventory with mastery ratings

---

### Skills and Talents

Skills are the most basic unit of performance. Most people think their skills are limited to specific work situations. The goal of this exercise is for you to take full stock of all of your skills, take note of the ones you enjoy the most, and to present them professionally.

According to researcher Sydney Fine, skills can be broken down into three categories: Knowledges, Self-management, and Transferable Skills.²

**Knowledges** are the topics you know, generally nouns.  
*Example: Spanish, chemical engineering, graphic design*

**Self-management skills** describe the way you do your work, generally adjectives/adverbs.  
*Example: Relentless, innovative, meticulous*

**Transferable skills** are the things you can do, generally verbs.  
*Example: Teach, paint, repair, negotiate*

Knowledge is knowing a second language. Self-Management is how often and diligently you practice. Transferable skill is using your second language to some benefit.

All of these are important. First, we want active verbs describing work you can do.

→ See Resource: List of Skills for ideas and more info ←

---

### Exercise 1.1.1: Transferable Skills Inventory

**Purpose:** Identify, document, and rank your transferable skills through professional reflection and story analysis using the SOARED framework.

---

#### Activity 1.1.1a: Professional Talents Audit

1. Record any talent you have used professionally.

   a) List every job you have had, every significant project you have completed, and every important course you have taken.




   b) For each item from part a), write down everything you had to do.





   c) Every task you completed is a skill you have. Grade each skill on Mastery:
   
   Novice (a, b, c, d, e) Master
   
   **Example:** Gas Metal Arc Welding (c), Spanish/English legal translation (d)




---

#### Activity 1.1.1b: Challenge Stories Collection

2. Think of a time you overcame a challenge (inside or outside of work), a time you soared, for each of the following statements. One challenge per statement.

   a) A time when you had an impact


   b) A time you did something no one else around could have done


   c) A time when you were genuinely excited


   d) A time when you impressed yourself


   e) A time when everything went according to plan


   f) A time when nothing went according to plan


   g) A time when you loved what you were doing


   h) A time you did something you would like to do again


   i) A time you did something you would not normally do


   j) Any other story which represents your skillset


---

#### Activity 1.1.1c: SOARED Story Development

3. Choose the three (3) most impactful stories and describe these events using the SOARED framework:³

   **S**ituation – describe the situation  
   **O**bstacle – describe the obstacle/problem you faced  
   **A**ction – describe your action: the step-by-step process you took to address the obstacle  
   **R**esult – describe the result of your actions  
   **E**valuation – your self-evaluation and/or how higher-ups received your actions  
   **D**iscovery – describe what you discovered from the process







*Note: You will use the SOARED framework throughout this program, particularly in Module 2.5 (Story Weaving) and during networking conversations in Part 3.*

---

#### Activity 1.1.1d: Skills Organization & Mastery Rating

4. Record every transferable skill you used in each of your stories. Refer to the List of Skills resource for reference.




   a) Organize your skillset from the most used to the least used.

### Exercise 1.1.2: Self-Management Skills Assessment

**Purpose:** Identify your self-management skills (soft skills) using personality assessment and self-reflection.

These are often referred to as Soft Skills. You can find lists of common soft skills that random internet people claim will get you any job. Describing ourselves can be difficult. Doing so originally and authentically can be even more challenging.

---

#### Self-Identification Basics

The Enneagram, Myers-Briggs, the Big 5, and the Self-Directed Search are the most commonly used personality tests. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and they are more alike than they are different.

We will be using an adaptation of Myers-Briggs⁴ as a tool to help us learn about ourselves. It will help you frame your personality in a way which is easier to understand and give you a starting place for finding creative ways to describe yourself. I do not put my full faith into any skills test for many reasons, so remember, this is only a tool.

No personality test is perfect. We will use an adaptation of the Myers-Briggs to give you a starting point for your Self-Inventory.

---

#### Activity 1.1.2a: Personality Type Discovery

The questionnaire will assign you a four-letter code upon completion. Each letter represents your bias on a set of four scales:

- **Extroversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)**
- **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)**
- **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)**
- **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)**

Few people fit their type perfectly. Do not let the results define you. Instead, consider the truths and make a note of the differences.

The purpose of this exercise is to illuminate your character traits and to open your mind to possibilities.

While taking the test, it is essential to answer the questions honestly, as they apply to you. There are no wrong answers. Although some of your responses may make you slightly uncomfortable, it is crucial to be as honest as you are able. The more accurate you are, the more this tool can help you.

**Take the free assessment at:** www.16personalities.com⁵

We need your four-letter code. Write it here: ___________

*(The website where you take the test is a useful resource. Feel free to learn about your type from them, but it is not necessary for this course. I provide you with everything you need to know.)*

---

#### Activity 1.1.2b: Dichotomy Self-Rating

To be more confident, read through each of these relative dichotomies and mark yourself on each scale below:

**Extraverts** are more likely to be energized by company, enjoy being the center of attention, keep a fast pace, and talk more than they listen.

**Introverts** are more likely to be energized by alone time, be more private, keep their thoughts to themselves, and listen before speaking.

________________________,_________________________  
E                                                  I

**Sensors** tend to be concerned with certainty and what is realistic. They tend to be more literal and are oriented towards the present situation.

**Intuitives** tend to be concerned with innovation and what is possible. They tend to be more figurative and are oriented towards the future.

________________________,_________________________  
S                                                  N

**Thinkers** are likely to be most concerned with logic, applying impersonal analysis to opportunities and decisions. They can be seen as detached or heartless.

**Feelers** are likely to be most concerned with harmony, empathizing with involved parties with tact when making decisions. May be seen as overemotional, valuing all feelings equally.

________________________,_________________________  
T                                                  F

**Judgers** tend to derive the most satisfaction with the completion of a task and manage their time as a finite resource.

**Perceivers** prefer to keep their options open and thrive when adapting to new situations. They often view time and deadlines as elastic.

________________________,_________________________  
J                                                  P

**See Resource: Personality Info for more information about each type:**
- Strengths & weaknesses
- Common character traits
- Strategies, descriptive words, & more

Remember, no test can tell you who you are, but these tools can help you describe your talents and identify your weaknesses.

---

#### Activity 1.1.2c: Soft Skills Identification

In the Personality Info resource, you will find Self-Management Skills that generally apply to your personality type.⁶ In the List of Skills resource, you will find a more thorough list of skills. The test you took will also provide insight into your self-management skills.

1. Review these resources. Record any characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses which describe you here:



2. Record 1-5 characteristics, strengths, or weaknesses which match your MBTI type, but not you personally, here. Explain why they are false:

4. Use your Self-Management Skills to accurately describe your top ten Transferable Skills (from Exercise 1.1.1):




5. Make a note of times you used your skills in the way you describe (possibly from your written stories in Activity 1.1.1c):




6. Add HONEST hard figures to your descriptions. Numbers. Data. Records. Accomplishments. They must be HONEST. You do not want to lie or exaggerate.

*Note: You will use this language when creating your resume in Module 3.2 and throughout your networking conversations in Part 3.*

---

### Exercise 1.1.3: Knowledge Audit

**Purpose:** Document all your areas of knowledge and expertise with mastery ratings.

Now dive into what you know. The subject matter, the processes, your interests, everything. It is imperative to include everything you know here (or at least as much as possible).

**Knowledges** are the things you know, generally nouns.  
*Example: Spanish, chemical engineering, graphic design*

From work. From your education.  
From your hobbies. From your interests.  
From any of your groups or clubs.  
If it comes to mind, write it down.

You want to start broad. Take stock of everything first.  
Then grade them according to Mastery.

**Module 1.1 Complete**  
Next: Module 1.2 - Work Factors 2 (Environment, People, Compensation)

---
# Part 1: Roots (Continued)

## Module 1.2: Work Factors 2

### Module Overview

**Focus:** Environment, People & Compensation  
**Purpose:** Identify your preferred work environment (macro and micro), ideal colleagues and supervisors, and compensation needs  
**Estimated Time:** 1.5-2 hours  
**Key Tools:** Ranking Grid, Budget Template  
**Partner Activity:** Exercise 1.2.1 (if applicable)  
**Outputs:**
- Top 10 ranked locations
- Ideal workplace description
- Ideal people profile
- Complete budget with minimum salary requirements (BATNA)

---

### Environment

**Location, Location, Location**

There are two types of location: Macro and Micro.

**Macro** – Where in the world do you want to be? Do you want to stay in your town or city? Or would you rather be somewhere else? Are there specific activities you wish to have access to? Do you need to live in a city? Or do you prefer the quiet life of the country?

**Micro** – What should your work environment be? Do you need to spend time outside? Is it necessary that you work near a park? Or do you prefer to spend your time indoors? What are your preferred working conditions? Micro-environment might be considered the look and feel of the workplace.

Of course, the more flexible you are, the more opportunities you will find. Also, generally speaking, where there are more people, there are more opportunities. Still, it is essential to know your preferences; you might find your dream job in your dream location. There is only one way to find out.

Do this exercise even if you feel you already know where you want to be. First of all, you might surprise yourself. If not, then you have found more evidence to support what you already thought.

---

### Exercise 1.2.1: Macro Environment Preferences

**Purpose:** Identify and rank your preferred geographic locations for living and working.

---

#### Activity 1.2.1a: Location Desires & Constraints

1. Do you know where you want to live?

   a) If you do, write that here. If not, write down the characteristics of a place that you might want to live.  
   *(Example: by the ocean, has an active nightlife, quiet, access to nature, etc.)*



   b) What are your location restraints?


   c) Do you need to live in a specific country?


   d) Do you need to stay close to your family?


   e) Do you have medical needs?



---

#### Activity 1.2.1b: Past Location Analysis

2. Struggling for ideas? Even if you are 100% certain, do the following:

   a) Write down every place you have lived.




   b) List every single thing you disliked about those places.  
   *(What does it have? What does it lack? What type of people are there? What feelings does it give you?)*



   c) List the opposites of each of the location traits you dislike. Also, list any positive traits that come to mind.



   d) Rank the positive location traits using the Ranking Grid (see Resources).



---

#### Activity 1.2.1c: Location Research (Internet)

3. Research. Open your mind to possibilities. Find as many good ideas as possible. Look for places that meet your needs and have as many of your top 5 location traits as possible.

   a) Search the Internet.
   
   - Search for places which excel in each of your desired traits. Make lists.



   - Are there any which excel in multiple?



   - Find 5-10 places which make you excited. Record what excites you about each location.



---

#### Activity 1.2.1d: Location Research (Network)

   b) Ask around. Family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances—you never know what treasure they hold until you ask.
   
   - Write down your ranked list of location traits and ask 10-20 people if they know of anywhere which has those traits. Write down their ideas. ALWAYS thank them for their time and effort.



   - Are there any locations which excel in multiple traits?



   - Research each of the locations which embody multiple of your desired traits.



   - Find 5-10 places which make you excited. Record what excites you about each location.



---

#### Activity 1.2.1e: Top 10 Location Ranking

4. Narrow down your two lists to a single list of 10 possible locations. Rank those ten from most exciting down.




5. **IF YOU HAVE A PARTNER**

   Before you make a list of locations – Before you start researching –

   - Both of you do Activities 1.2.1a & 1.2.1b separately.
   
   - Discuss your preferred location traits. Find any similarities.
   
   - Rank your combined traits using the Ranking Grid. (Combine the top 5 from each partner)
   
   - Then both of you complete Activity 1.2.1c & 1.2.1d
   
   - Do Activity 1.2.1e together. Compare your findings. Discuss honestly. Agree upon ten possible locations. Rank together.


6. Pay the most attention to, make a special note of, your top 3 locations.



---

### Exercise 1.2.2: Micro Environment Preferences

**Purpose:** Define your ideal workplace environment and conditions.

Now we will focus on the look and feel of the workplace.

For each of the following, consider each productive space you have ever had. You may include classrooms, a desk at home, a library, or a cafe. Any space where you get work done is worth studying.

---

#### Activity 1.2.2a: Workplace History Review

1. Previous Employment

   a) List every job you have had.



   b) List every work condition which had a positive impact upon you, your mood, or your effectiveness.



   c) List every work condition which had a negative impact upon you, your mood, or your effectiveness.



   d) What would the opposite of those negative influences be?



---

#### Activity 1.2.2b: Ideal Workplace Description

2. Consider the above. Describe your ideal workplace.




   a) How does the office look?


   b) What is nearby?


   c) Are there any important features?


   d) What part of the city or town is it best?


   e) Is it near child care?


   f) What else can you think of?


---

### Exercise 1.2.3: People Preferences

**Purpose:** Identify the characteristics of people you work well with and for.

For many, we spend more time with the people we work with than the people we live with. For that reason, aim to have a clear idea of whom you work well with, what types of people can help you to be more productive, and what kinds of people are a negative influence on your work and life.

Simply understanding these things does not guarantee that you will love your next co-workers, but it certainly helps to know what you are looking for.

It is also essential to understand the type of people you like to work for. You work for your boss, and you work for your client, customer, pupil, audience, family, organization, etc. You work for the people who depend on you to do your job.

Some people thrive in competitive environments while others need emotional support. Some people need specific direction, and others need to be left to their expertise. Some people work extraordinarily well in groups, and others prefer solitary labor.

This exercise is designed to help you identify the sorts of people you are productive with and for and the sorts of people you are not.

Refer to your complete list of experiences from Exercise 1.1.1 (Transferable Skills Inventory).

---

#### Activity 1.2.3a: Negative Influence Identification

1. Review each job or experience you have had. Recall and record the traits of the people who hurt your productivity in any way. Maybe you didn't like them, but do not focus on who they are. You need to pinpoint what about them made your work less productive. List the harmful character traits.


2. Write the antonym of each of the traits from number 1.


---

#### Activity 1.2.3b: Positive Influence Identification

3. Review each job or experience you have had. Recall and record the traits of the people who helped your productivity in any way.


4. Recall any time when you were particularly productive. The production can be from your education, the stories you wrote in Exercise 1.1.1, or work experience. Who was directing you? Were you serving anyone (client, etc.)?


5. What traits do the people from question 4 have that support a positive work environment?


---

#### Activity 1.2.3c: Ideal Colleague & Supervisor Profile

6. What types of people do you want to work with?


7. Do you prefer to work in teams, pairs, or alone?


8. What types of people do you want to work for?


9. Who in this world do you want to serve with your work?


---

### Exercise 1.2.4: Compensation Analysis

**Purpose:** Determine your financial needs, benefit requirements, and establish your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement).

How much money do you want to make?  
How much money do you need to make?  
What are your needs?  
How much do you plan to save?  
What bonuses and extras are you seeking from your work?

---

#### Activity 1.2.4a: Salary History

1. Record how much you have made at each of your positions, including any changes in pay at any one position.


---

#### Activity 1.2.4b: Budget Creation

2. Write a complete budget. Use the spreadsheet titled "Budget", or compare your own to the one I have provided. Costs are listed on the left. Fill in how much you spend per month on the right. Below you will find...

   – TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES →  
   – TOTAL ANNUAL EXPENSES →  
   – MINIMUM HOURLY WAGE →

Be diligent about your budget, and live within your means. Unless you are giving the loan, debt is not your friend. It is easy to spend money; it is difficult to save money. Wealth is built by saving and investing wisely.

---

#### Activity 1.2.4c: Benefits Assessment

3. What benefits do you need?



---

#### Activity 1.2.4d: Compensation Structure Evaluation

4. Describe the benefits and drawbacks of each, for you. (Assume bi-weekly or monthly paydays)

   **Salary** (aggregate pay per year or month, regardless of hours worked)


   **Hourly** (pay for time worked)


   **Contracting** (pay agreed upon per project, typical for freelancers)


   **Commission** (% of sale per sale)


   **Combination of above, or Other** (specify)


---

### Module 1.2 Footnotes

7. This approach to work-life integration draws from Paula Caligiuri's philosophy in *Get a Life, Not a Job: Do What You Love and Let Your Talents Work for You.* Upper Saddle River, NJ: FT Press, 2010. Caligiuri emphasizes that your work should support your life goals, not the other way around.

# Part 1: Roots (Continued)

## Module 1.3: Priorities, Ecstasy & Flow

### Module Overview

**Focus:** Prioritizing work factors and understanding your peak performance states  
**Purpose:** Rank your work factors by importance and identify activities that create flow states (high engagement + high energy)  
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour initial + ongoing daily tracking  
**Key Tools:** Ranking Grid, Flow Tracking Worksheet  
**Ongoing Practice:** Daily flow tracking continues through Part 3  
**Outputs:**
- Prioritized work factors (1-5 ranking)
- Flow patterns identification
- List of high-engagement, high-energy activities

---

### Exercise 1.3.1: Work Factor Prioritization

**Purpose:** Establish your personal hierarchy of work factors to guide career decisions.

Before we move on, you need to prioritize your work factors from Modules 1.1 & 1.2. Use the Ranking Grid (see Resources).

When considering employment, what is most important to you?

**The Five Work Factors:**

- **Compensation** – how much money you earn, benefits, and bonus structure
- **Environment** – where in the world you live and the make-up of your office
- **Skills** – being able to use the skills you have or learn new skills
- **Knowledges** – being able to excel in your field of interest or expertise
- **People** – getting along with the people you work with and for

---

#### Activity 1.3.1a: Five-Factor Ranking

Rank your work factors from most important (1) to least important (5):

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

If you feel the need to be more specific, do so here:




---

### Exercise 1.3.2: Flow State Mapping

**Purpose:** Identify activities and conditions that produce your optimal performance state.

You have documented all of your work factors and have thought about what is most important to you.

Now, I want you to recall the time when you were the most present. For this step, you will reflect upon your past experiences to get a sense of how they affected you and your fundamental motivation. I am talking about the studied and admired sensation of flow.

Human beings are hardwired to experience flow. During states of flow, people are upwards of 500% more effective or productive doing their work.⁸ In short, the body achieves this by turning off the prefrontal cortex, effectively allowing the brain to remove criticism and doubt, exist deeply in the present moment, make more lateral connections between new and old information, and innovate upon those newly created ideas seamlessly. The state is often described by the feeling of brilliant information flowing out of the subject, connecting one moment seamlessly to the next.

Everyone experiences flow from time to time; the most brilliant among us learn to use it to their advantage. You can increase your chances of flow by practicing mindful paced breathing. There are several books and entire businesses built around that fact, so I will spare you the details for now. Practice breathing evenly ("hoooooooooooo", not "ho ho ho ho ho ho ho") and in rhythm (try in for 5, out for 5). You may have been taught to breathe from your gut, but I want you to breathe from the core of your chest, more specifically your heart. Your heart is the generator of your body, and everything adapts around it, a concept called entrainment, so breathe from your core. Steady breath will help your heart beat more regularly, which will entrain the rest of your body to the same rhythm. When your body is all in rhythm, it resonates, creating a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. Practice breathing to increase your vitality and the amount of time you are in flow.

There is a great deal of research about the idea of "flow."⁸ Every expertise has its own word to describe the state; most people recognize "in the zone." Flow is often achieved when someone is pushed to their extreme limits after preparation. These are times when all of our skills and expertise are called upon, we shut out everything except the task at hand, and we execute on a very high level. Symptoms of flow include time distortion, being oblivious to anything other than the task, euphoria, extreme productivity, creative ease, and a sense of singular focus. If you have ever amazed yourself with what you could do or you accomplished something that did not seem possible at the start, you were probably experiencing flow.

Flow is similar to a sense of ecstasy, but ecstasy is more closely related to play than work. Ecstasy describes also being singular in mind and focus, being exactly where and when you are, but it refers to elation and bliss rather than accomplishment and execution. Some professionals differentiate between what we get joy from and the work that we do. The best way to live life is to align the two, just like our life values and our work values. Ecstasy is pure happiness, pure energy. Flow is the essence of the creative state. Physiologically, the two are more or less the same; these extreme mental states are characterized by a flood of powerful neurotransmitters.

#### Understanding the Flow Tracking System⁹

Separate flow into **focus** and **energy** for the purpose of picking your brain during this activity.

- Think of **focus** as being the scale between boring and captivating.
- Think of **energy** as being the scale between draining and energizing.

**When you are fully engaged and completely energized by a task, you are experiencing flow.**

**Example:** Stacy is a journalist who reported a huge corruption case a few years back. While doing the background research was a bit draining, she remembers being extremely focused. Then, there was one day when the whole story came together and she knew it was big. Once she had done her research, she spread out all her findings one night to try to crack the case. She can't quite say how she connected the dots—the memory is a bit blurry—but everything lined up for her as if she already knew all the answers; that was flow.

**For the following activities, you will need the worksheet titled "Flow Tracking" (see Resources)**

The document must be printed for the greatest effect. You may want to print several copies front and back.

You may absolutely fashion your own version of the worksheet by hand or create your own document. No matter what path you take, be certain to complete each of the steps.

**How to use the Flow Tracking Worksheet:**
1. Name the activity
2. Provide a very short description of the activity
3. Use the table on the right to mark your energy and focus level, coloring in each box below your mark
4. If you were in flow during the activity, write "flow" and circle it

#### Activity 1.3.2a: Memorable Past Flow Analysis

1. Recall all the significant events you have recorded in Modules 1.1 and 1.2. For each event, assign two scores: one for focus and one for energy.

   The most significant events, when you experienced flow, deserve more attention. Mark those events with the word "Flow."
   
   **Energy:** draining (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) energizing  
   **Focus:** boring (v, w, x, y, z) captivating
   
   **Example:** For Stacy, researching her case was a (-1, z) while the night of creative problem solving was (2, z) and induced flow.


2. Record your top 5-10 most focused activities on the Flow Tracking worksheet.


3. Record your top 5-10 most energizing activities on the Flow Tracking worksheet.


4. Is there any activity, task, or skill which you find both highly energizing and highly captivating?



---

#### Activity 1.3.2b: Recent Past Flow Tracking

Recall the past 3-10 days. (The more you do, the stronger the tool will be.)

1. Record every significant activity of each day on the Flow Tracking worksheet.

2. Write a short description of each activity on the lines provided.

3. Shade the boxes according to the energy and focus of the activity.

4. Are there any activities which you find both highly energizing and highly captivating?



---

#### Activity 1.3.2c: Present Flow Tracking (Ongoing)

**Repeat this process at the end of each day. Continue until Part 3 is complete.**

1. Record every significant activity of the day on the Flow Tracking worksheet.

2. Write a short description of each activity on the lines provided.

3. Shade the boxes according to the energy and captivation of the activity.

4. Are there any activities which you find both highly energizing and highly captivating?

*Note: This ongoing practice will provide crucial data for Module 2.3 (Landmarking) when you create your idea trees based on high-engagement activities.*

### Introduction

The focus of this module is love. I think all people have a sense of what love is. You might be more comfortable considering the things and people you care about.

Love can be a tricky topic to talk about. Love manifests in each person's life in a different way. You might have intensely positive, intensely negative, or completely neutral experiences in each of the categories below. The purpose of this activity is not to dictate right from wrong, but to reflect and understand.

Many programs focus on the idea of passion. Passion is simply one of the many paths into flow. Passion is also pretty ambiguous; only about 1 in 4 people know their passion. For our purposes, we will focus on what we love and care about as a window into what might bring us the most fulfillment in the future.

**There are no wrong answers here—these questions are for you and you only.** While you will be asked questions that relate to this topic, my staff and I will not have a copy of your answers; share what you are comfortable sharing.

**Answer every question.** The process works if you work it. This section is no less important than any other section. In fact, this might be one of the most important modules in the program. Seriously reflect on each of these, and record vivid details. Consider telling your stories using the SOARED framework (see Exercise 1.1.1c) so that you don't miss any important details.

Don't leave anything out. Some parts of your life might seem obvious or redundant—record them anyway. You cannot possibly be over-prepared. Do the work.

### Introduction

We will focus on mental health. Physical and spiritual health are both important, but I feel it is best for you to find answers to questions you may have about those topics from another source. People from all walks of life can benefit from mental health practices.

I am going to address three aspects of mental health: **achievement**, **fortitude**, and **emotional intelligence**.

In all three, the lesson is discipline and practice. The goal is not perfection. The goal is active practice.

Bill Burnett describes five mindsets which are imperative to our cause: **curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration**.¹ Mastering these mindsets and living them will lead you to opportunity.

---

### Exercise 1.5.1: Skill Sharpening Practice

**Purpose:** Commit to daily improvement of a skill that sets you apart.

Achievement is characterized by the things that we can do—otherwise known as our skills. In previous modules, we described our skills, our mastery over them, whether they give or take energy from us, and how captivated we are by them.

Whether it is for our own pleasure, to further our working cause, or to give us a competitive edge, it is crucial to be a student of life, for life. Everybody should always be improving themselves in one way or another.

The post-industrial economy is based on specialization. Pick a transferable skill or a knowledge which sets you apart from others—an expertise. If you do not have one, it is your duty to make one of your skills an expertise.

Additional practice, above and beyond what is needed for any of the work that you do, is self-improvement for the sake of self-improvement. Sharpen your skills to make you a better candidate than your competition.

**You will want to start as soon as possible. Today is best; right now is even better.**

---

#### Activity 1.5.1a: Skill Selection

1. Choose a skill to practice. (Review your top skills from Exercise 1.1.1e and your flow activities from Exercise 1.3.2)

   Selected skill:


---

#### Activity 1.5.1b: Daily Practice Commitment (Ongoing)

2. Dedicate at least 15 minutes of singular focus to improving that skill every single day.

3. Practice the skill every single day. Don't stop.

4. If you grow tired of practicing this skill, reach a level of mastery, or otherwise need a change, choose another skill and repeat the process. This is the never-ending task of self-betterment.

---

### Exercise 1.5.2: Grit Development

**Purpose:** Develop mental fortitude and personal accountability.

Grit describes the mental fortitude to work tirelessly for rewards which are either abstract or far removed, often both.¹¹ I am a proponent of working smarter, not harder, but there is no replacement for diligence, perseverance, and drive. You absolutely must take yourself seriously. Even if your profession is in comedy, be a comic, not a joke.

To get this message across, I have decided to share a personal story.

---

#### Take Yourself Seriously

On April 1st, 2016, I woke up at 3 pm. I had slept through two strategy meetings, an interview, training, and was supposed to be getting ready to go out knocking doors for the next 5 hours. I called my campaign director; she was furious, but more, she was sad.

Four months ago she had put her name on the line to bring me in to direct a field canvass that had, until that point, no direction and no hope. Enthusiastic and passionate, I left everything else behind to join her. We had been working 60+ hours each week to get going and had finally started to gain some momentum.

Tuesday, March 31st, we went to dinner and then to a local bar to watch some music. Long after my co-worker went home, I was the last patron in the bar, finishing something past my 20th drink, around 4 am. I had promised to be at work by 8:30. I had told myself before dinner that I would have two beers and be at work early, hoping for 8, thinking it would probably be 8:15.

I woke up in severe pain which had become all too common. I couldn't open my eyes. An attempt to stand was met with icy hot needles in my brain; I collapsed. Watching my drool inch across the hardwood, I considered the remedy I had taken for what was becoming countless days prior; I longed for the rye whiskey on my window sill.

I remembered the promises I had made: to my co-workers, to my employees, to the people who depended on me. I remembered the times I had been sent to the hospital for alcohol poisoning, and all the promises I had made to my Mother. I called Alex, who had done so much for me already, and told her I wasn't going to make it to work that day. No way.

That is when I realized that nothing I said mattered. Every promise I had made, I was breaking it. Both the spoken and the unspoken. Here I was, doing what I wanted to do, and throwing it all away. I wallowed for a bit on all the people I was letting down. But I had done that before. It got me nowhere. I thought about slowing drinking, but I had tried who knows how many times—hell, just last night was supposed to be slow.

When I finally pulled my face off the floor and crawled to the sink, I knew I had to do something I hadn't ever done before. I stared myself in the eyes, unsure of what would happen next. That's when I knew. **I had to take myself seriously.**

I had dreams, ambitions, goals, and more. Yet so far, I had let those sit idly by while I did as I pleased. No more. I told myself I would never drink again. I told myself that it was just the start. I made a promise to myself which I live by to this day. I promised accountability. Whatever challenge should come, I vowed to face it. I vowed to overcome. I promised to be the person I knew I was meant to be.

That day wasn't the first time I had made promises to myself. So, I vowed to take myself seriously. I can still see my face. The most resolute I had ever been, and terrified of what was to come. In those eyes I see relief. Finally, I was going to take myself seriously, and no one could stop me.

Since that day, my entire life has changed. I have been and am sober. I quit smoking. I revolutionized my diet. I started working out regularly. I have found time for my spirituality. I fell in love. I moved to another continent. I started a business. **I take myself seriously.**

---

Overcoming addiction, changing your life, creating your story, standing up for yourself, surmounting your fears, starting your next project, building your dreams—no matter what you plan on doing next, **TAKE YOURSELF SERIOUSLY**. Every day. Never stop. This is grit.¹¹ Daily sacrifice for long-term gain.

I don't mean to wear nice clothes and look people in the eye (although those are useful habits for networking). I mean, look yourself in the mirror and hold yourself accountable. Every single day. No one else can tell you what you need to do. No one else can do the things you need to do. I am giving you all the help you need to live a more fulfilled life. The rest is up to you. You are your greatest enemy and your greatest ally. Choose to be your ally. Every day. No matter how hard it is. Don't lie to yourself—you'll know. Take yourself seriously.

**Do the things you know you need to do.**

Be relentless.¹²

---

#### Activity 1.5.2a: Role Model Identification

1. Who do you look up to? Who is your role model? Why?


2. What about that person (those people) do you admire? What characteristics do they have that you don't?


---

#### Activity 1.5.2b: Habit Assessment

3. What are the bad habits you need to quit?


4. What are the good habits you need to start?


---

#### Activity 1.5.2c: Promise Keeping

5. What promises do you need to keep? To yourself? To those you care about?


6. What has stopped you from keeping those promises?


---

#### Activity 1.5.2d: Accountability Practice

7. Choose an order to accomplish these. If you need, start with the easy ones and work up. No matter what, choose one to complete as soon as you possibly can. Start building active trust in yourself.


8. Forgive yourself when you mess up. If you fall off the horse, focus on getting back on the horse, not on the fact that you fell off. Forgive. Take yourself seriously—if you don't, who will? Next.

---

### Exercise 1.5.3: Mindfulness Practice

**Purpose:** Develop mental discipline through daily mindfulness practice.

Mindfulness is rooted in the eastern practice of meditation. I am not asking you to chant mantras or do yoga unless that is what you want to do. What I am talking about is discipline for your mind. Silencing your mind is difficult. Try thinking about nothing for the next 5 minutes.

...

Too hard? How about only thinking about your breath for the next 2 minutes.

...

How did you do? Did your mind wander? It is okay if it did. The important thing is practicing the act of coming back to silence. Practice batting down thoughts and distractions. The world is more distracting today than it ever has been. Grabbing attention is a trillion-dollar business.

So, why is this important? I am glad you asked.

Your brain is just like every other muscle; the parts you exercise get stronger. Mindfulness uses emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is otherwise known as keeping a level head in the face of animosity. Psychologists have shown this works, neurologists agree, and some cultures have been practicing this basic technique for thousands of years.

Training your brain to focus, to stay calm, and to shut out distractions will improve your soft skills, make you more able to communicate with others, improve your mental energy, and make you generally grittier.

You can spend as much or as little time on this as you think necessary. I highly suggest taking it seriously.

---

#### Activity 1.5.3a: Daily Mindfulness Setup

Spend between 5 and 20 minutes a day practicing mindfulness. Focus on your breath. Push out all distractions. Silence your inner voice for a period each and every day.

Some people do this while completing thoughtless tasks, but it is most effective when practiced on its own. Do what works best for you.

**My mindfulness commitment:**
- Time of day:
- Duration:
- Location:

---

### Exercise 1.5.4: Routine Establishment

**Purpose:** Create an intentional daily routine that incorporates all your new practices.

Routine is the final point of this module. A routine is the manifestation of discipline. Whether you realize it or not, you have a routine. Humans are creatures of habit, and that will never change.

My task for you is to consider your routine intentionally. Do you wander through your day from one thing to the next? Or is there a method to your day?

Either way, this part has given you at least three tasks which demand your attention every day:

1. **Flow Tracking** (from Exercise 1.3.2c) – tracking your daily activities, how they affect your energy, and how engaged you are in them

2. **Skill Sharpening** (from Exercise 1.5.1b) – choosing a useful and enjoyable skill to hone, practice, and sharpen as a way to stand out from your peers and, more importantly, to better yourself

3. **Mindfulness** (from Exercise 1.5.3a) – set aside a short amount of time to practice quieting your mind each day

Finally, remember the five mindsets every day:¹

- **Curiosity**
- **Bias to action**
- **Reframing**
- **Awareness**
- **Radical collaboration**

---

#### Activity 1.5.4a: Routine Design

I have provided you with a daily schedule to help you accomplish and keep track of these tasks.

Use the "Routine" template (see Resources). It takes about five weeks to break old habits and build new ones. If you start now, exercising your brain will become a part of your daily routine before you finish the course.

**Design your daily routine here:**

Morning:


Midday:


Evening:
