4,1,0,0,0,content,instruction,,,,"The first part of the tree is the roots. The roots tell us where we came from, where we have been, and what makes us up. Understanding your roots will help them to grow, furthering the stability of your tree, allowing you to reach ever greater heights. Without our roots, we have nothing to hold us up while we reach for the sky."
5,1,0,0,0,content,instruction,,,,"Roots are hard. Factual and literal, they are a part of history. Now is not the time for conjecture, imagination, or possibilities; those will come in later parts.

Of the four parts of life, most adults are worst at play."
10,1,0,0,0,content,instruction,,,,"**Love** is mostly for you to define. I cannot, and will not, advise you on matters of love. If you so choose, there are plenty of other resources on the topic. None-the-less, it is vital for every person and should be considered when planning your future."
11,1,0,0,0,content,instruction,,,,"Traditionally, **health** is broken into three categories: physical, mental, and spiritual. To reach the greatest heights, care for all three of these areas. I suggest you consider and look after your physical and spiritual health on your own. There are many resources available in the world to answer any questions you have about physical and spiritual help. Everyone has different physical and spiritual needs, so the exercises here focus on mental health. The importance of health cannot be understated."
