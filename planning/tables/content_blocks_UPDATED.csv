Overview
The first part of the tree is the roots. The roots tell us where we came from, where we have been, and what makes us up. Understanding your roots will help them to grow, furthering the stability of your tree, allowing you to reach ever greater heights. Without our roots, we have nothing to hold us up while we reach for the sky.
Roots are hard. Factual and literal, they are a part of history. Now is not the time for conjecture, imagination, or possibilities; those will come into play later. No two root systems look the same, different people have different needs, skills, and preferences, but the basic components are the same.
With this and every activity, be honest with yourself. Honesty is always the answer. Don't lie and don't exaggerate. Nobody wins when you lie. Give yourself credit for the things you have done. Acknowledge even the smallest accomplishments.
Life designer, Bill Burnett, separates our life into four categories: love, health, work, and play.¹ These will be our four primary roots.",1,True
100002,instruction,"Work is anything related to the creation of value. Work is any economic activity, regardless of your compensation for that activity. Any activities you engage in with the intent of attaining some goal is work. Doing chores, volunteering, earning degrees, and sales are all to be considered work.",1,True
100003,instruction,"Play is nearly the opposite. Play is any activity you engage in for the joy of doing it. If you are competing or trying to accomplish something, then it is not play. Play is what most young children do, without a worry in the world, motivated only by the joy that will come. Of the four parts of life, most adults are worst at play.",1,True
100004,instruction,"Love is mostly for you to define. I cannot, and will not, advise you on matters of love. If you so choose, there are plenty of other resources on the topic. Nonetheless, it is vital for every person and should be considered when planning your future.",1,True
100005,instruction,"Traditionally, health is broken into three categories: physical, mental, and spiritual. To reach the greatest heights, care for all three of these areas. I suggest you consider and look after your physical and spiritual health on your own. There are many resources available in the world to answer any questions you have about physical and spiritual help. Everyone has different physical and spiritual needs, so the exercises here focus on mental health. The importance of health cannot be overstated.",1,True

During states of flow, people are upwards of 500% more effective or productive doing their work.⁵ In short, the body achieves this by turning off the prefrontal cortex, effectively allowing the brain to remove criticism and doubt, exist deeply in the present moment, make more lateral connections between new and old information, and innovate upon those newly created ideas seamlessly. The state is often described by the feeling of brilliant information flowing out of the subject, connecting one moment seamlessly to the next.",1,True
100213,instruction,"Everyone experiences flow from time to time, the most brilliant among us learn to use it to their advantage. You can increase your chances of flow by practicing mindful paced breathing. There are several books and entire businesses built around that fact, so I will spare you the details for now. Practice breathing evenly (""hoooooooooooo"", not ""ho ho ho ho ho ho ho"") and in rhythm (try in for 5, out for 5). You may have been taught to breathe from your gut, but I want you to breathe from the core of your chest, more specifically your heart. There is a concept called entrainment. Entrainment is the phenomena of rhythmic alignment; it occurs across physics, biology and social interactions. Training your nervous system to breathe from your core, you can entrain your physiology on your heart. Dive into this rabbit hole if it piques your interest, but the basic concept is that by eliminating chaos, you benefit from the calm power of harmony at a physiological level.

These times, generally from childhood, demonstrate that you are a human, who possibly overcame something significant.

Prospective employers likely won't be drawn to someone who builds their identity around failure. With that said, do not gloat, brag, or be overly self-congratulatory. Your story needs to be about a positive success without being too cocky. Overstating your achievements will turn your audience off, and make them doubt your credibility.

To engage your audience emotionally, your story needs to include some emotional reality for you.

Being overly descriptive can be annoying, and possibly a pointless endeavor. Your goal is not to be Emerson.

100573,instruction,"That said, this is not the most compelling tactic of persuasive storytelling; the preeminent objective is portraying your authentic humanity. The reason you need to consider your audience is that people are empathetic to situations with which they can relate. For example, if you are sharing an experience about writing code with sales associates, the monotony of drafting 10,000 lines of code will likely fall on deaf ears. To better your chances, consider what struggles the salespeople have overcome themselves. For instance, tell your coding story from the angle of overcoming denial and repeated failure to reach eventual triumph.
