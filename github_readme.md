## What This Is

The kind of structured self-reflection that executives pay coaches thousands of dollars for — made accessible to everyone.

Three parts. Fifteen modules. A journey from self-knowledge to action.

| Part | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Roots** | Who you are — skills, values, what energizes you |
| **Trunk** | Your story — connecting past to future |
| **Branches** | Taking action — presence, networking, opportunities |

## Why Open Source

Trust requires transparency. The code is public so you can verify what we do with your data (nothing) and how we handle your information (encryption you control).

AGPL-3.0 means DreamTree stays free and open. Use it, learn from it, contribute to it.

## Principles

- Your data belongs to you, not us
- No gamification — no points, badges, or streaks
- Technology should feel human
- Contributions deserve recognition
